# Web Components: Template & (some) Shadow DOM Practice

This is some really simple Web Components code I hacked together, just so I could better understand how WC works. It mainly focuses on templates but also uses a little Shadow DOM.

[View the demo!!! &raquo;](http://kaidez.com/samples/template-shadowdom-practice/)

The code is documented in both `index.html` [here](https://github.com/kaidez/template-shadowdom-practice/blob/master/index.html) and `scripts/main.js` [here](https://github.com/kaidez/template-shadowdom-practice/blob/master/scripts/main.js), so you MIGHT have a enough info to start using the code right now. But for an in-depth look at the code, view this blog post here (blog post will be available on August 13th, 2014 at about 7 AM US Easter Standard Time).
