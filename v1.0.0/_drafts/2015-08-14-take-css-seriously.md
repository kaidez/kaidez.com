I've always tried to avoid rants on my blog because I've felt my opinion didn't matter. I know how to write client-side code and think I'm <em>pretty</em> good at it, but I'm not a "well-known leader in the web development community."

But I've created enough quality code for established companies and <a href="/lynda-kaidez/">I've taught web development courses for a well-respected e-learning company</a>. All this makes me feel I've earned the right to rant about things that I <em>know</em> we web dev should be doing.

And I <em>know</em> we need to do a better job of shipping high-quality CSS.
