*Note: This site no longer includes a 'Coolsites' section.*

EXTREMELY cool, scannable info-graphic displaying up-to-date data on which browsers support which HTML5/CSS3 features. Created by [Divya Manian][1], [Paul Irish][2], and others. As an FYI, Manian and Irish as a team, created [HTML5 Boilerplate][3]…another Coolsite of mine.

Also in Coolsites, I moved Smashing Magazine from Coding Favorites to Personal Favorites.

My Coolsites list is getting long, so I’m thinking about creating a new page of learning resources that I’ve used and endorsed.
