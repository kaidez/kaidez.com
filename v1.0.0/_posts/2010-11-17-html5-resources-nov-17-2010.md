## Video For Everybody!

A simple block of code for properly implementing the HTML5  tag. It includes detection code, thumbnail placeholder tag and is heavily commented so you know how things work. *Best of all*, there’s are detailed notes on HTML5 video at the end. One of the best HTML5-related resources out right now. ([Sitelink»][1])

Lots great tutorials and code snippets. Also includes a update of [Eric Meyer’s famous CSS Reset][2] that’s rewritten for HTML5 (get that [here][3]). Lots of useful stuff. ([Sitelink»][4])
