There’s so much that want to learn, web development-wise, that I’ve found myself trying to do too much at once. And there’s only so much I can do with a toddler in the house.

One of my New Year’s resolutions was to be more organized in general. I’ve started setting this up in my home life, but I’ve also made some decisions as far as how to organized my web dev learning process:

## Nighttime (after the kid goes to bed)

*   Monday, Wednesday & Friday: .NET Review
*   Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, & Saturday: HTML5 & CSS3 Review

## Morning & Lunchtime

*   Blogging

I’m leaving myself some flexibility with the schedule and know that I may need to adjust it in the future. But this is how I’m trying to do things currently.
