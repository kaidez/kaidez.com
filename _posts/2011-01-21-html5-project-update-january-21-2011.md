My [HTML5 Project][1] is a centerpiece of this blog. I’ve been slacking on it but I’ve now made some decisions:

I’m going to create a personal portfolio of my web design/development work: both at Revlon and freelance. My initial goal was to create another blog, but I struggled to find a topic. Plus, I want to monetize it which meant doing a lot of research in order find the *right* topic.

I don’t want to rush the research process and want to make the right decision in terms of a monetized blog, but I also want to start developing in HTML5 *now*. Therefore, creating an HTML5 portfolio site seems to be the right move for now. 

That being said, here’s my plan for said site:

## Research

*   reading many of the various articles at [HTML5 Doctor][2].
*   *thoroughly* review sites featured at [HTML5 Gallery][3] to get a firm understanding of the proper HTML5 layout.
*   create site wireframes.
*   create a simple site architectural document. research WordPress page layout to understand the best way to convert it to HTML5
*   create site mock-ups.
*   start developing.

## Firm development techniques will be:

*   implementing CSS3.
*   using both the [jQuery][4] and [Modernizr][5] JavaScript libraries.
*   ***hand-coding*** in Dreamweaver to take advantage of [its great HTML5 code-hinting][6].

## Two things I haven’t made a firm decision on:

*   whether or not to use [CSS3 PIE][7]…it’s good for what it does but doesn’t do much right now. Plus, it *might* conflict with Modernizr.
*   whether or not to use WordPress…I need to be 100% positive that I can regularly ad content to this site, and this will be tough to do with a kid. Otherwise, static PHP pages will be fine for now.

That’s it!!! WISH ME LUCK!!!
