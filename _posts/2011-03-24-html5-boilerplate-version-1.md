On March 21st, 2011, HTML5 Boilerplate moved out of beta to version 1.0. [Paul Irish][3] and [Divya Manian][4] have always been the main developers behind it, but Boilerplate’s popularity has drawn in a TON of others to contribute code to the cause. The end result is a very-close-to-perfect template for front-end web development.

While there are lots of small code updates, there are also three important additions:

*   **Boilerplate Builder Script**: The biggest addition, hands down. A script that cleans up your code and optimizes your images, resulting in a tweaked-to-the-max website that loads faster. It needs to run via command line.
*   **Initializr Integration**: As it is with [jQuery UI][5] and [Modernizr 2.0 Beta][6], HTML5 Boilerplate now allows you to customize your build for download. It does this by integrating [Initializr][7], allowing you to pick and choose which server configuration, JavaScript and CSS you want to use on your site. Decide what you want, then download all the code.
*   **Documentation**: Pretty much every question about Boilerplate is answered here. Contains a few broken links as of this post but it’s still comprehensive.

There are also **two new how-to videos**: a getting started one by Manian (great for newbies) and a build script walk-through by Irish.

HTML5 Boilerplate has really stepped its status as must-have tool for web developers. Props to all those involved for making all of our lives easier!!!!
