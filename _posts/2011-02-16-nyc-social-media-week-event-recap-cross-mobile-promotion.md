*Correction: In a previous version of this article, Farrah Bostic was incorrectly identified as Kristin Volk in a photo caption, and vice versa. All of the opening statistics, starting with “only 30% of the mobile users have a smartphone,” were incorrectly attributed to coming from Kristen Volk only).*

As mentioned in my last post, a friend at JWT got me into the top two panels for [NYC Social Media Week 2011][1]: the social listening one, titled **“Pay Attention! Social Listening Done Right;” **and the mobile promotion one, titled **Cross-Mobile Brand Strategy**.

[I’ve already recapped the second biggest one, the social listening panel][2] so it’s time to recap the big one: the mobile strategy panel. This panel was the most-anticipated and, interestingly enough, the most-surprising one of the conference.

The panel topic was just as the title says, *how to properly integrate a mobile strategy into your overall marketing plan*. Its main takeaway was:

>  
> 
> iPhones and Androids provide a great user experience and we should care about the new functionality that they provide. But when it comes to effective product and brand promotion, they under-perform when compared to both text messaging and the mobile web, at least, for now. Whatever your mobile strategy though, it should “play a role” in your promotional campaign, not “be” your promotional campaign, Plus, it needs to interact with good, desirable content. Because content is, indeed, king.
