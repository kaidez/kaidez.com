One reason why I’m curious about HTML5 is because of Apple’s issues with the Adobe Flash web animation program. 

About a year ago from this post, Steve Jobs called Flash a “memory hog” and stated that Apple wouldn’t support it on either the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. He said that these devices would instead use HTML5 and Quicktime to display video, even though Flash is the unspoken web video standard.

Steve said this at a time when it looked like the iPhone would rule the smartphone market for awhile and the iPad would be the cool new gadget everyone wanted. It’s a year later and the iPhone is losing market share to Google’s Android while the iPad is “cool,” but not as “cool” as Apple thought it would be.
