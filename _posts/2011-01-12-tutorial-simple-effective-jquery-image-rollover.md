I used the following code to create the image rollovers for [the recent Almay project I worked on][1].

 [1]: http://kaidez.com/almay-project-using-html5-net-jquery/

Truthfully, I wasn’t going to post this: I found it on another site and felt that re-posting it here would be claiming it as my own creation. But I found quite a few other sites using the exact same script, so I’m not the only one re-posting it. Plus, this rollover code works…well I might add. It doesn’t use CSS, making it much more cross-browser compliant; it’s not as buggy as some other JavaScript rollover code I’ve encountered, and it gets the job done with very little code. 

I’m viewing all those other re-posts as an endorsement of how almost-perfect this code is. Here’s my endorsement: 

     
    
    
    
    A Simple jQuery Image Rollover
    
    
    
    
    $(document).ready(function() {
    $("img.rollover").hover( 
    function() { this.src = this.src.replace("_off", "_on"); 
    }, 
    function() { this.src = this.src.replace("_on", "_off"); 
    });
    }); 
    
    
    
     
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    





First, make sure that you create your rollover images. Each individual rollover needs two images attached to it: one named ‘yourFilename_off.gif’ and the other named ‘yourFilename_on.gif’. As long as these images are of the same file type, it doesn’t matter what file type it is. GIF, JPEG, PNG…it doesn’t matter. For this example, I have four images that will be used in two rollovers:

*   ‘imageOne_off.png’
*   ‘imageOne_on.png’
*   ‘imageTwo_off.png’
*   ‘imageTwo_off.png’

And now the code breakdown…

We make sure to embed the jQuery library into our web page grabbing the one stored over at jquery.com:

    
    





Next, we tell jQuery that every time an image tag with a class name of “rollover” gets moused over, it should **simultaneously** perform two tasks:

*   it should see if the image contains the word “\_off” in the filename…if it does, replace it with “\_on” which will force the “_on” version of image to load.  

*   it should see if the image contains the word “\_on” in the filename…if it does, replace it with “\_off” which will force the “_off” version of image to load.

    
    $(document).ready(function() {
    $("img.rollover").hover( 
    function() { this.src = this.src.replace("_off", "_on"); 
    }, 
    function() { this.src = this.src.replace("_on", "_off"); 
    });
    }); 
    
    





And from here, we just place the images on the web page, making sure that they have a class name of “rollover”:

    [![][3]][3]
    
    [![][4]][4]

That’s it!!! The best rollover code I’ve ever used!!!
