The good news is, my "Remove Files From GitHub" tutorial is showing up in a lot of search results....an average of 1400 appearances a month. The not-so-good news is, the click-throughs are low...an average of 25 a month.

That being said, that's a lot of appearances so I should look at this as an opportunity. So [as I mentioned in a recent post](/site-update/ "Find out what content direction kaidez took with this site"), I tweaked the content with the hopes of making this tutorial more SEO/SEM friendly.

The tweaks went as follows:

* __Added, updated and removed copy__: make it more to the point.

* __Got rid of all the images__: there were screenshots of terminal commands and my GitHub repo. The terminal screenshots have been replaced with syntax highlighting and the repo shots have been deleted in full. This also keeps me from running up my [MaxCDN](http://tracking.maxcdn.com/c/72639/3968/378 "Visit MaxCDN: a content delivery network provider") charges. :-)

* __Rewrote the meta description__: the goal here was to rewrite this so people are enticied people to click through to whole post.  There is a technical catch with this: the old meta description was still embedded in the Open Graph and needed to be replaced with the new one. This was done with the [Facebook Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug)...formerly known as the Linter.

* __Added some new links to the resource list at the end__: props to lynda.com and Tim Pope.
