I've been planning this post for a few months now. My initial plan was to make it my 100th post, marking that milestone as a time to review my growth as a web developer.

But some satisfying events during my first month at my new job have forced me to publish it now in the hopes it will help other web devs, especially the beginning ones. The things discussed here have helped me grow as a developer in more ways then I can count.

Other developers like [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/2013/05/10/justcode/ "Read '#JUSTCODE' by Christian Heilmann") and [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/ "Read 'Write Code Every Day' by John Resig") have discussed these things before, and probably more elegantly than I'm about to discuss them here. But they should transcend to all developers so one more blog post about them won't hurt.

Simply put: write code every day.

Every.

F#%king.

Day.

## About the new job
As mentioned in my last post, [I left Revlon](/revlon/ "Read about kaidez leaving Revlon") and took a front end developer position at [Everyday Health](http://www.everydayhealth.com/ "Visit Everyday Health") where I perform a variety of web stack-based tasks. By web stack, I mean I work primarily with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The first tasks I was given were JavaScript and CSS bug fixes. I also had to rewrite some HTML and make it cross-browser/device compliant, but I started off by dealing with those bugs. 

Then I was handed a project where I had to refactor some JS functionality related to the redesign of a web form. This was obviously tougher than the bug fixes.

I've always been a bit insecure about my web stack skills being up to par, specifically the JavaScript one. JS  seemingly goes through changes every minute and keeping up with the changes takes effort, so I've always been a little concerned as to whether or not my JS skills were up-to-date.

And I went into the new job with this concern. But a funny thing happened: I was able to do everything I was asked to do.

I'm not saying that the bugs were so easy that a five-year old could fix them (they weren't), or that my approach to the refactor makes me the world's greatest web developer (it doesn't). I saying that I wasn't intimidated by the tasks I was given because my skills are better than I'm giving myself credit for.

## Why are my skills are better than I'm giving myself credit for?

I am 100% convinced that my ability to do the job is the direct result of a decision I made months ago to try write at least one piece of web stack code a day. I missed some days but I've mostly followed through with this decision.

Some of the code was for work, some of it was for [the lynda.com courses I created](/lynda-kaidez/ "Read about the lynda.com courses I created"). Most of it was just my trying out some new framework or tool, or just playing with a certain part of the JavaScript API.

I ended up writing a lot of code...lots and lots and lots of code. Here's a recent snapshot of my GitHub commit map that proves it:

  <img src="/img/git-contrib-map.jpg" class="imgBorderMaxWidth" alt="kaidez GitHub Contribution Map" /> 
  <figcaption style="margin:20px auto 0;"><em>Includes private repos...</em></figcaption>
</figure>

As a result of all this, here's what happened at the new job:

* loading content in a complex RESTful API onto the page wasn't a problem for me.

* using jQuery to manage state and data and not just for fancy fade-ins wasn't a problem for me.

* fixing cross-browser errors related to CSS transitions wasn't a problem for me.

* writing feature detection with pure JavaScript instead of Modernizr wasn't a problem for me.

* creating a responsive web site without using something like Bootstrap or Foundation wasn't a problem for me.

## You are a Web ~~Developer~~ Engineer
I also learned about a lot of quirky problems while doing my daily coding. In fact, lots of the bugs I had to fix were done by remembering how I solved those problems.

That's important because __a big part of a web developer's job is solving problems.__ It's easily 70% of the job while, at the same time, is the most under-spoken part of it.

It's an assumed skill-set for engineers of all types however...mechanical, electrical, etc. For example: the railroads built in across the continental United States in the mid-1800's wouldn't have come to be without engineers....someone had to solve the problem of laying flat tracks among the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. 

Like those engineers, we web devs are also architects that build cool things with code, but our jobs require us to be engineers when we build the cool things. Like those engineers, it's our job to not only solve problems with the things we build, but we need to anticipate the problems before we start building in the first place.

It's because of this that I'm a bit uncomfortable with the term "web developer" and think "web engineer" better describes our jobs. And constant writing of code makes is all better engineers. 

## Where do you go from here?

You go and start coding.  Here's how I suggest you do things:

* __Track your progress with GitHub__: building up that above commit map was a nice way to track the progress of my daily coding.  Lengthening my "Current Streak" as much as I could was always a nice pat on the back I gave myself. 

* __Write a lot of code, but make sure you maintain a work/life balance__: [I tweeted about coding everyday once](https://twitter.com/kaidez/status/596670528515104768) but Christian Heilmann chimed in saying that a social life is also needed. I didn't say that in my original tweet but do agree with him. Too many programmers code morning, noon and night while sacrificing their social life. To be clear I definitely don't recommend that.

* __Share what you learn__: my next tutorial might be on a well-documented jQuery thing that's been discussed on countless other blogs. But it helped me solve a problem and changed my approach to building web apps. If I share what I learned here in an elegant way, I know the tutorial will help someone else. You should do the same: start a blog and write a lot of posts that say, "this was my problem, this is how I solved it, this is what I learned." Write posts with the goal of helping people instead of inciting them to click on ads.

## Conclusion

[Alex Sexton](https://twitter.com/SlexAxton "Visit Alex Sexton on Twitter") delivered the best statement ever for learning web development:

> <em>"The only way that I've found that I'm able to stay up to date is by creating. I follow a well-curated list of people on twitter, and read blogs and programming news sites, but when it comes down to it, the only time I'm ever really learning is when I'm doing.

> When I want to learn something, I'll just start a project with it, and along the way I'll figure out the other tools I need to be successful. After a few failed attempts, normally I can create something meaningful (that I usually throw away anyways) that allows me to understand core concepts and/or make quick uninformed jabs about things that I don't like or understand."</em>

In the past, I spent too much time trying to learn by reading lots of books, taking classes and attending conferences when I should have learned by <em>doing</em>. I spent the better part of the last year "doing" and am performing well at a job that I was nervous about at the start.

And it's all because I tried to write code every day.

Every.

F#%king.

Day.
