I've been thinking about this particular post for a few months now. My initial plan was to make this my 100th post, marking that milestone as a time to review my growth as a web developer.

But some satisfying events during the first two weeks at [my new job](/revlon/ "Read about kaidez leaving Revlon") have forced me to publish it now in the hopes it will help other web devs, especially beginning ones. The things discussed here have helped me grow as a developer in more ways then I can count.

Both [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/2013/05/10/justcode/ "Read '#JUSTCODE' by Christian Heilmann") and [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/ "Read 'Write Code Every Day' by John Resig") have discussed these things before, probably more elegantly than I'm about to discuss them. But these things must transcend to all developers, so one more blog post about them won't hurt.

Simply put: write code every day.

Every.

Fucking.

Day.

## About the new job
As mentioned in my last post, I took a front end dev job at a health and wellness digital company called [Everyday Health](http://www.everydayhealth.com/ "Visit Everyday Health") where I perform a variety of web stack-based tasks. By web stack, I mean I work primarily with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The first tasks I was giving were bug fixes, mostly JavaScript and CSS ones. I also had to rewrite some HTML for the sake of cross-browser/device compliance, but I most dealt with those bugs. 

I've always been a bit insecure about my web stack skills being up to par, specifically the JavaScript one. JavaScript is an anomaly that seemingly goes through changes every minute, especially in recent years, so I went into the new job a little worried whether or not my JS skills were up-to-date enough to do a specific job.

So I was nervous about how whether or not I could fix these bugs but a funny thing happened. I was able to fix them...quickly.

I don't mean to say that the bugs were so simple that a five-year old could fix them (they weren't), or that I just realized I'm the world's greatest web developer (I'm not). I mean to say that I knew what I needed to do to both determine the cause of the problems and then fix them, and never struggled to do all this.

So my skills are better than I'm giving myself credit for.

## How I did all this

I am 100% convinced my skills are better thanks a decision I made months ago to try write at least one piece of web stack code a day. I missed as few days but I've mostly followed through with this decision.

Some of the code was work-related, some of it was for [the lynda.com courses I created](/lynda-kaidez/ "Read about the lynda.com courses I created"). A lot of it was just me firing up a new Git repo and trying out some new library or framework, or a specific part of the JavaScript API.

And in many cases, the code I wrote required I learn something I didn't know before. This included promises, complex JavaScript inheritance, web components and developing code in a Node environment.

Learning new code things almost always requires the need to solve problems, particularly with JS. Something doesn't act in the browser the way you thought it would...you have to solve a problem.

Here's where I go off on a tangent...

## You are a Web ~~Developer~~ Engineer

I readily admit to understanding this late: that solving coding problems is part of my job as a web dev. There were incidents at Revlon in the past where I took too long in solving problems, ticking off my team as a result.

These incidents were actually the catalyst for my writing code everyday. And by doing just that, by writing specific code just to learn instead of because someone asked me to, I learned a lot about the problems generated by these quirks and how to solve them.

"Solving problems" is an under-spoken skill for web developers, but it's a must-have skill for engineers of all types...mechanical, electrical, etc.  And it's this "under-spoken-ness" that I have a problem with, because we web dev types really are engineers and not developers.

We are not bug-fixers all the time: we are certainly architects and get to build coll things. But we also have be engineers when we build stuff, meaning we need to not only solve problems with the things we build, but we need to anticipate them before we start building in the first place.
