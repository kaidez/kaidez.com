I've been thinking about this particular post for a while now, editing it in my brain for the past few months. My initial plan was to make it my 100th post and treat it as a specific milestone of my web development career.

But some satisfying events during the first week-and-a-half at [my new job](/revlon/ "Read about kaidez leaving Revlon") have forced my me to publish it now in the hopes that it will help some web devs of all levels. Because the things discussed here have helped me grow as a web developer in more ways then I can count.

Both [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/2013/05/10/justcode/ "Read '#JUSTCODE' by Christian Heilmann") and [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/ "Read 'Write Code Every Day' by John Resig") have written about these things before, probably more elegantly than I'm about to. But the sentiment has to transcend to all developers, especially those that want a long web dev career.

Simply put: write code every day.

Every.

Fucking.

Day.

## About the new job
As mentioned in my last post, I took a front end dev job at a health and wellness digital company called [Everyday Health](http://www.everydayhealth.com/ "Visit Everyday Health") where I perform a variety of web stack-based tasks. By web stack, I mean I work primarily with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The first tasks I was giving were bug fixes, mostly JavaScript and CSS ones. I also had to rewrite some HTML for the sake of cross-browser/device compliance, but I most dealt with those bugs. 

I've always been a bit insecure about my web stack skills being up to par, specifically the JavaScript one. JS is an anomaly that seemingly goes through changes every minute, especially in recent years, so I went into the new job a little worried about my overall performance.

So I was nervous about how well I would do when I started tackling these bugs but a funny thing happened. I was able to fix them...quickly.

I don't mean to say that the bugs were so simple that a five-year old could fix them, or that I just realized I'm the world's greatest web developer. I mean to say that I knew what I needed to do to both determine the cause of the problem and then fix it.

So my skills are better than I'm giving myself credit for.

## How I did all this

I am 100% convinced that all this came to be thanks a decision I made months ago to try write at least one piece of web stack code a day. I missed as few days as my GitHub contribution map shows, but I've mostly followed through with this decision.

Some of the code was work-related, some of it was for [the lynda.com courses I created](/lynda-kaidez/ "Read about the lynda.com courses I created"). A lot of it was just me firing up a new Git repo and trying out some new concept library or framework.

And in many cases, the code I wrote required I learn something I didn't know before. This included promises, complex JavaScript inheritance, web components and developing code in a Node environment.

Learning new code things almost always requires the need to solve problems, particularly with JS. Something doesn't load up for whatever reason...you have to figure out why.

Which is good, because if you working in web dev, solving problems is your job.
