Quite possibly, *the* most inspirational speech in existence on not only WordPress search engine optimization but blogging itself. Given by Joost de Valk, AKA Yoast; owner of the awesome [site of the same name][1].

Yes, he provides quite a few technical tips but he *really* drives home the need for bloggers to engage their readers…never easy but nonetheless required.

Be forewarned…Yoast pulls no punches about what is and isn’t bad WordPress SEO practice. And if you use [Semper Fi’s All In One SEO Pack plugin][2], be prepared to rethink about how you’re currently using it.
