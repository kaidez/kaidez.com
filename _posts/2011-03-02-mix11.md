Don’t hate the player: yes, it’s in Vegas and we’re staying at the gorgeous Mandalay Bay, but everyone I know that’s been to past MIX conferences say that from a programming standpoint, they learned at least one new thing that helped them in their career. Whether via the daily coding events or the Q&A sessions with industry experts, they all left knowing more than they did when the arrived.

Best of all, we’re flying out a day early for their one-day rapid-fire coding workshops, or bootcamps. There are two bootcamp sessions: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. There are five bootcamps per session and I can take a total of two; one per session.

I’m attending these two bootcamps…

**HTML5/CSS3 with Stephanie (Sullivan) Rewis of W3Conversions** – I don’t know much about Rewis but she’s at a Microsoft conference running a very intense class about a very hot topic in the web dev world. So let’s assume she’s good. Plus, how can I have this blog and *not* go to this?!?!?!

**jQuery with Joe Marini of Microsoft** – If you’re a web developer, *this* guy needs no introduction. While he’s a jack-of-all-trades in terms of web development, Marini is tied with Dori Smith for the #1 JavaScript Guru title. So a jQuery coding session run by this guy is a *really* good thing! 

And yes, I’ll slip in a few hands of blackjack.

Anyone else going?
