## Video For Everybody!

A simple block of code for properly implementing the HTML5  tag. It includes detection code, thumbnail placeholder tag and is heavily commented so you know how things work. *Best of all*, there’s are detailed notes on HTML5 video at the end. One of the best HTML5-related resources out right now. ([Sitelink»][1])
