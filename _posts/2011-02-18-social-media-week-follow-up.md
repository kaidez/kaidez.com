A HUGE thank you to JWT/New York for Tweeting one of the articles and, of course, gratitude upon gratitude to **Heather Duffy Wales** at JWT/Atlanta for not only sharing them with her co-workers, but also getting me into both panels in the first place!!!!!!

**Kristin Volk of MediaVest**, one of the panelists on the mobile strategy panel, also shared that respective article with quite a few people. There were a few of panel points which, for the sake of space, I had to omit. Kristin made some points that I didn’t include, but she would like to share:

> “...I did keep making the point that smartphones are still only 30% of mobile phones, and I mentioned that there are now more mobile devices than PCs and TVs combined, making it the first screen now, not the third.
> 
>   
>   
> In addition to [showing] the monk photo, I was the one who quoted Confucius (whom I dubbed the original social media guru) — ‘Tell me and I’ll forget, show me and I’ll remember, involve me and I’ll understand,’ to reinforce the need to make mobile campaigns participatory, not intrusive.  
>   
> I also spoke about the need to integrate mobile into your overall campaign, not treat it as a standalone entity (as in ‘Let’s do an app!’), in order to leverage the wonderful synergies that mobile brings to the other channels.”  
>   
> I emphasized how we must put people first when creating mobile campaigns, and think about what kind of meaningful experience we can give them, whether entertainment or utility.  
>   
> I made the point that agencies and brands are no longer calling the shots, consumers are (communications has evolved from a dictatorship to a democracy).”
 

With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I wish I had mentioned, at least, the Confucius content in the original article.
