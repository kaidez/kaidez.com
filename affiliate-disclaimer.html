    <h1>Affiliate Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>
    	kaidez.com is wholly owned by Kai Gittens, who has entered agreements with certain parties to link to their goods.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The hope of both Kai Gittens and these parties is that you will purchase their services via these links: Gittens receives a commission when this occurs.
    </p>

    As of September 1, 2013, these parties include:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.lynda.com/promo/trial/Default.aspx?lpk35=1833&utm_medium=ldc-partner&utm_source=SSPRC&utm_content=655&utm_campaign=CD2146&bid=655&aid=CD2146&dp=15772&opt=">lynda.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">amazon.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">MaxCDN</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    	kaidez.com also displays ads from Google Adsense: Gittens does not receive commissions if you purchase goods and services via these links but may receive a commssion if you go through a certain click stream that starts with clicking on these links.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The best way to think about it is: if you click on a link from this site to a third-party, you should assume that you have earned Kai Gittens money.
