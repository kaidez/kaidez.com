    <h1>Affiliate Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>
    	kaidez.com is wholly owned by Kai Gittens, who has entered agreements with third parties to link to their goods and services.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The hope of both Kai Gittens and these third parties is that you will purchase their goods and services via these links. For every third party good and/or service you purchase via these links, Gittens will receive a commission.
    </p>

    As of October 5, 2013, these third parties include:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.lynda.com/promo/trial/Default.aspx?lpk35=1833&utm_medium=ldc-partner&utm_source=SSPRC&utm_content=655&utm_campaign=CD2146&bid=655&aid=CD2146&dp=15772&opt=" title="lynda.com: a kaidez.com affiliate">lynda.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="#" title="Amazon: a kaidez.com affiliate">amazon.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="#" title="MaxCDN: a kaidez.com affiliate">MaxCDN</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mediatemple.net#a_aid=5068b81963acf" title="Media Temple: a kaidez.com affiliate">Media Temple</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    	kaidez.com also allows third-party ads to be displayed via Google Adsense. Gittens does not receive commissions if you purchase goods and services via the links in these ads, but may receive a commission if you go through a certain click stream that starts with clicking on these links.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The best way to think about it is this: if you click on a link from this site to a third party, you should assume that you are beginning a process that will earn Kai Gittens money.
    </p>
