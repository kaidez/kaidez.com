*"It very well may be the best Javascript book ever written...read it!"*

There was a moment where I considered making that sentence the content for this entire post, and then just publishing it and moving on. But I guess I have to embellish.

Written by [Dave Herman of Mozilla](https://twitter.com/littlecalculist), *Effective JavaScript* is not a book with a lot of tutorials or an explanation of a particular library or framework. This is a book that takes 68 specific concepts of the JavaScript language and explains them in depth and with amazing clarity.

For example: Item3 spends time explaining all the benefits of properly implementing type coercion with the `typeof` operator.
