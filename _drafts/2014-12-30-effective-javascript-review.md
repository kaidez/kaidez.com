*"It very well may be the best JavaScript book ever written...read it!"*

There was a moment where I considered making that sentence the content for this entire post, and then just publishing it and moving on. But I guess I have to embellish.

Written by [Dave Herman of Mozilla](https://twitter.com/littlecalculist), *Effective JavaScript* is not a book with a lot of tutorials or an explanation of a particular library or framework. This is a book that takes 68 specific concepts of the JavaScript language and explains them in depth, and with amazing clarity.

For example: Item 6 spends time clarifying the how semicolons do (and don't) work in JavaScript. How adding them in some code spots prevent errors and how adding them in other spots can pretty much screw the code up.

Chapter 3 contains 12 excellent items covering functions. Commonly complex subjects like `call` and `apply` are fleshed out really REALLY well.

For me personally, the sixth chapter on "Library and API Design" was worth the price of the book alone and [I've publicly said so](https://twitter.com/kaidez/status/507690685378887680). The day I learning the intricacies of what it takes to create jQuery-like chainable, configurable methods was a good day.

Also for me personally, parts I already understood were fleshed out.  Prototypes, JavaScript's inheritance paradigm, are something that I study constantly, but I still learned some new tips and tricks for implementing them.

And that's the point: you will come across concepts that you've already read about when reading *Effective JavaScript*. Commonly recommended books like [*JavaScript: The Good Parts*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kaidez-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596517742) and [JavaScript Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806752/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kaidez-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596806752) have covered lots of the material discussed in *Effective*.

But *Effective* takes many the most popular JS concepts you probably understand and teaches you things you never knew about them. No matter how much you know about JS, you *will* learn something new.

*Effective JavaScript* is not a beginner's book and assumes you understand variables functions, objects and arrays. Having a basic understanding of how to use all those things in a function is assumed as well.

If you understand all those things, you want to read *Effective JavaScript* sooner than later. You may have read the both *The Good Parts* and *Patterns* as well (and you should at some point), but if you're an intermediate JavaScript developer, *Effective JavaScript*  will change your life.

That is all.
