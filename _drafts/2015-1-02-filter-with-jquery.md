A recent personal project required that content in a certain category be removed on a link click. So if the page has two groups of content, clicking on one link would filter out the first group, displaying that first group while removing the second one.

Armed with [my newly-found discoveries about data attributes](/load-data-attributes-mouseclicks/ "Read kaidez's blog post on loading in page content with data attributes"), I solved the problem using it along with a handful of jQuery methods: `jQuery.filter()`, `jQuery :not()` and `jQuery :contains`. There are probably a few different ways to solve this problem but this is how I did it.

To begin with, there are three files at use here: `index.html`, `styles.css` and `main.js`.  All the files are in the same directory.

The styles in `styles.css` are arbitrary and are here to give the page SOME style.  They have no bearing on the functionality and won't be discussed in depth in the post, but here they are...
{% prism css %}
body {
  background-color: rgba(60, 105, 145, 1);
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);
  font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;
  font-size: 20px;
}

a {
  margin:0 5px;
}

a:link {
  color: rgba(100, 255, 0, 1);
}

a:visited {
  color: rgba(100, 255, 0, 1);
}

a:hover {
  color: rgba(0, 255, 193, 1);
  text-decoration: none;
}
{% endprism %}
The `index.html` file is key and looks like this...
{% prism markup %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Filter Content On A Click With jQuery</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" media="all" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Filter by team</h1>

    <!-- The Teams -->
    <a href="#" class="btn-player" data-team="chelsea">Chelsea</a>
    <a href="#" class="btn-player" data-team="psg">Paris St-Germain</a>
    <a href="#" class="btn-player" data-team="real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>
    <a href="#" class="btn-player" data-team="barcelona">Barcelona</a>
    <a href="#" id="btn-show-all">SHOW ALL PLAYERS</a>

    <!-- The Players -->
    <div class="player" data-players-team="chelsea">Cesc Fabregas</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="psg">Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="real-madrid">Cristiano Ronaldo</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="chelsea">Didier Drogba</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="chelsea">John Terry</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="barcelona">Lionel Messi</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="real-madrid">Sergio Ramos</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="chelsea">Thibault Courtois</div>
    <div class="player" data-players-team="psg">Thiago Motta</div>

    <!-- Note that we're using the oldIE-friendly version of jQuery -->
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.js"></script>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endprism %}
Take note that that the page has two distinct sections: a list of footie teams at the top (except for the last one) and the list of footie players directly below that. Except for the last one, every item in the top list is a link with a class name of `btn-player` and a data attribute called `data-team`.

The `btn-player` class name is important and will be discussed but for now, notice that the values of the `data-team` attribute differ across the links that have it. There are four different values across these links: 1) `chelsea`, 2) `psg`, 3) `real-madrid` and 4) `barcelona`.

At the bottom of this list is a link with an ID of `#btn-show-all`. If any content has been removed, clicking on this link will add all of it back to the page.  

Every item in the bottom list is a `<div>` with a class name of `player` and a data attribute called `data-players-team`. The `player` class name is important and will be discussed but for now, notice that the values of the `data-players-team` attribute are shared across some of the `<div>` tags.

For example: four tags have their `data-players-team` value set to `chelsea`, two of them have their attribute set `psg`. And so on and so on.

Most importantly, take note that the values of the `data-players-team`  attribute in the section below matches the value of one of the `data-team` attributes in the section above. So the four tags with a `data-players-team` attribute with a value of `chelsea` match the value of the `data-team` attribute in the first `<a>` tag: it's value is also `chelsea`.

These shared values are assisting in binding the content to their respective links...when of those links are clicked, they'll understand that it's their bound `<div>` tags that content should be visible.

But this is only a small part of the binding process...jQuery does a lot here too.  That code is in `main.js` and looks like this:
{% prism javascript %}
$( ".btn-player" ).click(function(){

  var getLinkType, getElType, getElNotType;

  // Feature-detect for dataset support
  if( !this.dataset ) { // If IE 10 or lower
    getLinkType = this.getAttribute( "data-team" );
   } else { // For other browsers
     getLinkType = this.dataset.team;
   }

  getElType = $( "div[data-players-team~="+getLinkType+"]" );

  getElNotType = $( "div:not([data-players-team~="+getLinkType+"])" );

   $( ".player" ).filter( getElNotType ).css( "display", "none" );
   $( ".player" ).filter( getElType ).css( "display", "block" );

});

$( "#btn-show-all" ).click(function() {
  $( ".player" ).css( "display", "block" );
});
{% endprism %}

Quite a bit to discuss here...let's break it down:

{% prism javascript %}
$( ".btn-player" ).click(function(){
  ...
});
{% endprism %}

There are four link at the top with a class name of `btn-player`. Whenever one of those buttons are clicked, a function will run and do a lot of stuff.

{% prism javascript %}
var getLinkType, getElType, getElNotType;
{% endprism %}

List three variables in a single var pattern for future use.

{% prism javascript %}
// Feature-detect for dataset support
if( !this.dataset ) { // If IE 10 or lower
  getLinkType = this.getAttribute( "data-team" );
} else { // For other browsers
  getLinkType = this.dataset.team;
}
{% endprism %}

Whatever `btn-player` link gets clicked has a `data-team` attribute. Our code needs to find the value of that attribute and store it in the previously-created `getLinkType` variable, and JavaScript's `this` keyword makes sure we're looking the value for the `data-team` value for the clicked-on link only.

But data-attributes can't be found unless the browser supports `dataset` properties for elements. Internet Explorer versions 10 and lower don't support that so we need to do a little feature detection.

We'll start by checking to see if the clicked-on link does NOT have a `dataset` property. And if it doesn't, we'll use the `getAttribute()` method to find the value of `data-team` and store it in the `getLinkType` variable.

But for browsers other than IE 10 and lower, we can use `dataset` to find the value of `data-team` and store it in the `getLinkType` variable. For a more in-depth discussion about data attributes and `getAttribute()`, read an older post of mine [here](/load-data-attributes-mouseclicks/ "Read kaidez's blog post on loading in page content with data attributes").

{% prism javascript %}
getElType = $( "div[data-players-team~="+getLinkType+"]" );
{% endprism %}
jQuery's "Attribute Contains" selector functionality can help us here. jQuery has a lot of uses for this selector but in this case, we're using the [Attribute Contains Word Selector](http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-word-selector/).

In this case, "Attribute Contains" is looking for any `<div>` whose `data-players-team` value matches that of `getLinkType`. The total `<div>` tags that match this criteria are stored in the previously-created `getElType` variable.

In other words, if the `.btn-player` button that gets clicked has a `data-team` value of `chelsea`, then `chelsea` gets stored in `getLinkType`. Then, the "Attribute Contains" code will look for any `<div>` whose `data-players-team` value matches that of the current value of `getLinkType`...it will find four `<div>` tags in this case.

{% prism javascript %}
getElNotType = $( "div:not([data-players-team~="+getLinkType+"])" );
{% endprism %}
