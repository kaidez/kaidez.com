Happy 10th Birthday AJAX!!!!

Ten years ago today, web developer J[esse James Garrett wrote his ground-breaking AJAX article](http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/) and changed the world in the process. At least, the world of web development.

If you're reading this and are a non-techincal person, understand that AJAX described an efficient method to load content onto a web page.  This method *would* come about eventually...the growth of the internet was evolving towards it.

But *if* AJAX didn't happen for some bizzarre reason, then the growth of the internet would have stagnated. And Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Pinterest, Apple and Google (*especially* Google) wouldn't have enjoyed the success they're enjoying today.

I have a really old AJAX tutorial that's in need of a serious update. So in honor of this birthday, I'm releasing [an updated new, in-depth AJAX tutorial] (/ajax-tutorial/).

A preamble...

Every January 1st, I review my site's traffic for the previous year. For the past two years, my tutorial titled ["http://localhost:4000/ajax-jquery-html5-work-together/"](/ajax-jquery-html5-work-together/) is always at towards the top.

Again, this article is old...it was published on January 11th, 2011
