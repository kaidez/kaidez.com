Happy 10th Birthday AJAX!

Ten years ago today, web developer Jesse James Garrett wrote his [AJAX article](http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/) and changed the world in the process. At least, the world of web development.

If you're reading this and are a non-techincal person, understand that AJAX described an efficient method to load content onto a web page.  This method *would* come about eventually...the growth of the internet was evolving towards it.

But *if* AJAX didn't happen for some bizzarre reason AJAX, the growth of the internet would have stagnated. And Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Pinterest, Apple and Google (*especially* Google) wouldn't have enjoyed the success they're enjoying today.
