With all our iPhones, iPads, Droids, iPods, Windows Phones and Nexuses, we've lost sight of the fact that Napster was the initial spark that brought mobile convergence to public conciseness. Napster started a revolution which demonstrated how pervasive music was, Apple then capitalized on the revolution by creating a device to manage the music and, this, became the catalyst for an era of mobile innovation that's really only JUST beginning.

*Downloaded* does a great job of documenting the *zeitgeist* that surrounded Napster during [the dot-com bubble of the late Nineties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble "Read about the dot-com bubble on Wikipedia") as well as the legal issues around them, but makes no mention of how certain business decisions kept the company from at least *trying to avoid their legal problems.  Decisions that were mostly made by one man.
