meta-excerpt: Downloaded properly recaps the Napster story & properly highlights the company's historical importance, but doesn't tell the WHOLE story.

With all our iPhones, iPads, Windows Phones and Nexuses, we've lost sight of the fact that Napster was the initial spark that brought mobile convergence to public conciseness. Napster started a revolution which demonstrated how pervasive music was, Apple capitalized on the revolution by creating a device to manage the music and began an era of mobile device innovation that's really only JUST beginning.

Yes, there would be no iPhone without Napster and *Downloaded* does a great job of documenting its story, catching the *zeitgeist* that surrounded it during [the dot-com bubble of the late Nineties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble "Read about the dot-com bubble on Wikipedia"). But Napster also.
