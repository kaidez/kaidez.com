Looking at our iPhones, iPads, Droids, iPods, Windows Phones and Nexuses, it's easy to forget that Napster, the music file sharing software, was the initial spark for mobile convergence. Napsterstarted a revolution which demonstrated how pervasive music was, Apple then capitalized on the revolution by creating a portable device to manage the music and, thus, became the catalyst for an era of mobile innovation that's really only JUST beginning.

*Downloaded* does a great job of documenting the zeitgeist that surrounded Napster during [the dot-com bubble of the late Nineties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble "Read about the dot-com bubble on Wikipedia") as well as the legal issues around them, but makes no mention of how certain business decisions kept the company from at least *trying* to avoid their legal problems.  Decisions that were mostly made by one man.

Directed by Alex Winter of "Bill & Ted" fame (as well as [the really bizarre, NSFW Butthole Surfers movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBLUrDOxVX4 "Watch Butthole Surfers Entering Texas Bar-B-Que Movie")), *Downloaded* is a movie that HAD to happen.
