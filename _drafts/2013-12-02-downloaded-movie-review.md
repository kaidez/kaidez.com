With all the focus we place on our iPhones, iPads, iPods, Droids, Windows Phones, Nexuses, etc., it's easy to forget that Napster, the controversial music file sharing software, was a major spark for mobile convergence. Napster started a revolution which demonstrated how pervasive music was and Apple capitalized on that by creating an easy-to-use portable device to manage the music, a device that was the catalyst for an era of mobile innovation that's really only JUST beginning.

Directed by Alex Winter of "Bill & Ted" fame (as well as [the bizarre, NSFW Butthole Surfers movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBLUrDOxVX4 "Watch Butthole Surfers 'Entering Texas Bar-B-Que Movie'")), *Downloaded* does a great job documenting the Napster story and gives them credit where credit is due. But it makes no mention of how the company MIGHT have survived its legal problems were it not for certain business decisions...decisions that were mostly made by one man.

Before we get to the review, it needs to be said that *Downloaded* is a movie that HAD to be made. No one has really denied Napster's influence but not enough have emphasized it and while this documentary is a great reminder, other things they brought to the table should be highlighted.

Thanks to the press it received, Napster was the first *real* look that the general public got of hacker culture. And this has carried over because every time you see how hacking is embedded in the fabric of places like Bethesda, MD, the Park Slope neighborhood in Brookyln and even [Romania](http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/in-romania-a-quiet-city-has-become-the-global-hub-for-hackers-and-online-crooks/hacking-hacker-romania-pirate-scam-internet-website/c4s10532/#.UpUGLmRDs5U "Romania's hacking city"), the spirit of Napster is there.

While Napster was built with already-existing technologies, the way its team got the technologies to work together was innovative. Napster was a centralized system but it also networked millions of computers, getting them to work together to manage, send and receive a ton of content. Napster was very a much an early prototype for cloud computing.

More profoundly, Napster was the first real challenge that the then new Internet-based business industry presented to the old economy one. Napster's rise came at the tail-end of the dot-com rush, just as the old economy couldn't see a clear profit model for the Internet and started to walk away from it. They would still walk away for a short time period but when they saw Napster's role in all but destroying the music industry, the old economy always kept a close eye on the web.  Napster forced the old economy to take the Internet seriously.

*Downloaded* may not mention all of these points but it's still a great history lesson.  It starts off with an introductory history of the Internet and nicely segues into Napster's early history. How Shawn Fanning was trying to make easier to find MP3 music files and how, with the input of friends such as Sean Parker, he knocked out the first version of Napster.

The documentary does effectively capture hacking culture. It shows how Fanning and the other Napster developers would work around the clock to improve the software, all of whom would get a the rush after solving and figuring out problems. Combine that with many of them living and partying together, and a camaraderie was created among the team as continued to better the Napster software.

Music artists such as Henry Rollins, Noel Gallagher from Oasis and DJ Spooky (who also created *Downloaded's* soundtrack) make excellent points about the how music business was way behind on tech. Music biz mean like Chris Blackwell from Island Records, Seymour Stein from Sire and former Sony President Don Ienner make   Records Chris Blackwell (who also discovered Bob Marley) the labels, themselves didn't pay artists that much


Napster would spread like wildfire and create a ton of legal issues for them, putting them in a head-to-head battle with the music industry and the latter's view is presented in a somewhat fair manner. Hilary Rosen, the former President of Recording Industry Association of America that pro-Naspter community painted as public enemy number one during the legal fight gets her say in *Downloaded*. She shares the recording industry's side of the argument but also concedes that the industry got rid of their technology departments, which allowed things like Napster to come about.
