With all the focus we place on our iPhones, iPads, Droids, iPods, Windows Phones, Nexuses, etc., it's easy to forget that it was Napster, the music file sharing software, that was a major spark for mobile convergence.

And they did this well: Napster was making their technology better everyday (even t. also the didn't release their software under open source, the press they gained gave most of us (this writer included) our first exposure to open source software,
