With all the focus we place on our iPhones, iPads, iPods, Droids, Windows Phones, Nexuses, etc., it's easy to forget that Napster, the controversial music file sharing software, was a major spark for mobile convergence. Napster started a revolution which demonstrated how pervasive music was and Apple capitalized on that by creating an easy-to-use portable device to manage the music, a device that was the catalyst for an era of mobile innovation that's really only JUST beginning.

Directed by Alex Winter of "Bill & Ted" fame (as well as [the bizarre, NSFW Butthole Surfers movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBLUrDOxVX4 "Watch Butthole Surfers 'Entering Texas Bar-B-Que Movie'")), *Downloaded* does a great job documenting the Napster story and gives them credit where credit is due. But it makes no mention of how the company MIGHT have survived its legal problems were it not for certain business decisions...decisions that were mostly made by one man.

Before we get to the review, it needs to be said that *Downloaded* is a movie that HAD to be made. No one has really denied Napster's influence but not enough have emphasized it and while this documentary is a great reminder, other things they brought to the table should be highlighted.

Thanks to the press it received, Napster was the first *real* look that the general public got of hacker culture. And this has carried over because every time you see how hacking is embedded in the fabric of places like Bethesda, MD, the Park Slope neighborhood in Brookyln and even [Romania](http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/in-romania-a-quiet-city-has-become-the-global-hub-for-hackers-and-online-crooks/hacking-hacker-romania-pirate-scam-internet-website/c4s10532/#.UpUGLmRDs5U "Romania's hacking city"), the spirit of Napster is there.

While Napster was built with already-existing technologies, the way its team got the technologies to work together was innovative. Napster was a centralized system but it also networked millions of computers, getting them to work together to send, receive a ton of content. Napster was very a much an early prototype for cloud computing.

More profoundly, Napster was the first real challenge that the Internet-based business industry presented to the old economy one. Napster's rise came at the tail-end of the dot-com rush, just as the old economy couldn't see a clear profit model for the Internet and started to walk away from it. They would still walk away for a short time period but when they saw Napster's role in all but destroying the music industry, the old economy always kept a close eye on the web.  Napster forced the world to take the Internet seriously.
