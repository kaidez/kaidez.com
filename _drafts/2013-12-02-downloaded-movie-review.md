As much as we focus on our iPhones, iPads, Droids, iPods, Windows Phones, Nexuses and so on, it's easy to forget that it was Napster, the music file sharing software, that was the initial spark for mobile convergence. Napster started a revolution which demonstrated how pervasive music was, Apple then capitalized on the revolution by creating a portable device to manage the music and became the catalyst for an era of mobile innovation that's really only JUST beginning.

*Downloaded* does a great job of documenting the zeitgeist that surrounded Napster during [the dot-com bubble of the late Nineties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble "Read about the dot-com bubble on Wikipedia") as well as the legal issues around them, but makes no mention of how certain business decisions kept the company from at least *trying* to avoid their legal problems.

Also thanks to the press, Napster was also the first time that most were exposed to the open source software, combining already-existing technologies : they didn't create any new technologies, they just combined many of them and utilized them in unique way. And they did this well: Napster was making their technology better everyday (even t. also the didn't release their software under open source, the press they gained gave most of us (this writer included) our first exposure to open source software,
