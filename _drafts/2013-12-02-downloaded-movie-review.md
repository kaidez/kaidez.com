With all the focus we place on our iPhones, iPads, iPods, Droids, Windows Phones, Nexuses, etc., it's easy to forget that Napster, the controversial music file sharing software, was a major spark for mobile convergence. Napster started a revolution which demonstrated how pervasive music was and Apple capitalized on that by creating an easy-to-use portable device to manage the music, a device that was the catalyst for an era of mobile innovation that's really only JUST beginning.

Directed by Alex Winter of "Bill & Ted" fame (as well as [a bizarre, NSFW Butthole Surfers movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBLUrDOxVX4 "Watch Butthole Surfers 'Entering Texas Bar-B-Que Movie'")), *Downloaded* does a great job documenting the Napster story and gives them credit where credit is due. But it makes no mention of how the company MIGHT have survived its legal problems were it not for certain business decisions...decisions that were mostly made by one man.

Despite that one shortcoming, *Downloaded* is a movie that HAD to be made. No one has ever really denied Napster's historical importance but not enough have gone out the way to emphasize it.

Napster was the first serious instance of the Internet-based business model pulling consumers away from the old economy business model. Or, to pull a quote from one of the *Downloaded* interviewees, "This is the first time technology actually attacked the existing system and started to take it away."

Napster's rise began at the tail-end of the dotcom rush, just as the old economy started walking away from Internet due its ambiguous profit model. But when they saw how Napster gave consumers exactly what they wanted, while all but destroying the music industry in the process, they regrouped their Internet efforts instead of ignoring them. Napster forced the old economy to take the Internet seriously.

*Downloaded* starts off with a short but excellent introductory history of the Internet and nicely segues into Napster's beginnings. How Shawn Fanning was trying to make easier to find MP3 music files and how, with the input of his friends from IRC such as Sean Parker, he knocked out the first version of Napster.

The documentary does effectively capture hacking culture. It shows how Fanning and the other Napster developers would work around the clock to improve the software, all of whom would get a the rush after solving and figuring out problems. Combine that with many of them living and partying together, and a camaraderie was created among the team as continued to better the Napster software...a great snapshot of hacking culture. 

Music artists such as Henry Rollins, Noel Gallagher from Oasis and DJ Spooky (who also created *Downloaded's* soundtrack) make excellent points about the how music business was way behind on tech. Music biz men like Chris Blackwell from Island Records, Seymour Stein from Sire and former Sony President Don Ienner provide an excellent historical perspective of the music biz. Blackwell (who also discovered Bob Marley) the labels, themselves didn't pay artists that much


Napster would spread like wildfire and create a ton of legal issues for them, putting them in a head-to-head battle with the music industry and the latter's view is presented in a somewhat fair manner. Hilary Rosen, the former President of Recording Industry Association of America that pro-Naspter community painted as public enemy number one during the legal fight gets her say in *Downloaded*. She shares the recording industry's side of the argument but also concedes that the industry got rid of their technology departments, which allowed things like Napster to come about.
