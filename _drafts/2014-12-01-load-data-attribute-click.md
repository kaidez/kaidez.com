A recent project at work *almost* required the use of swapping information in and out of the DOM with data attributes (usually referred to as `data-*`), and to do so with mouseclicks. I hadn't used them much so I researched some current production code we had and also did some web searches.

The final project requirements forced us not to do this but while doing the web searches, I was unable to find any good, descriptive tutorials on the subject. That surprised me so while using info on my favorite footie teams, I spent a few days hacking some code together, all while taking note of the quirks and cross-browser issues, and created this tutorial.

Simple Example (<a href="http://codepen.io/kaidez/pen/WbvEab" target="blank">See the CodePen Demo</a>)
---------------------
Before we create code that changes/swaps the `data-*` content in different places, let's look at an example of how to load in just one set of data. It's pretty simple: store content in data attributes for certain elements, then use JavaScript to load the content into other elements.

First, the CSS looks like this...the CSS will be applied to all future code samples and demos:
{% prism css %}
body {
  background: grey;
  color: #000;
  font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 900;
  font-size: 18px;
}

a:link {
  color: #fff;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 22px;
}

a:visited {
  color: #fff;
}

a:hover {
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.dataTarget {
  margin: 10px 0;
}
{% endprism %}

Next, the HTML looks like this:
{% prism markup %}
<a href="#" id="chelseaLink">Load Chelsea FC Info &raquo;</a>

<div
id="teamInfo"
data-team="Chelsea"
data-home-pitch="Stanford Bridge"
data-manager="JosÃ© Mourinho">


</div>  

<div id="team" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="homePitch" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="manager" class="dataTarget"></div>
{% endprism %}


And the JavaScript that allows for the content that gets loaded on a mouseclick looks like this:
{% prism javascript %}
var team = document.querySelector("#team"),
homePitch = document.querySelector("#homePitch"),
manager = document.querySelector("#manager");

$("#chelseaLink").click(function(){

  // Use the .dataset property
  team.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.team;
  homePitch.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.homePitch;
  manager.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.manager;

});
{% endprism %}

Cross-browser coding for android: as close to hell on earth as I've ever gotten.

make sure the CSS is consistent across all CodePen samples
