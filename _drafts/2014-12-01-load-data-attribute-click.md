A recent project at work *almost* required my creating functionality that loaded content stored in HTML5 data attributes onto a web page with mouse clicks. At that point, I had used data attributes in practice code a bit, but readily admitted to not knowing everything about them.

I did some web searches on data attributes and was shocked at the lack of good, descriptive tutorials on the subject. Although I ended up not using them in the work project, I still spent a few days hacking some related code together (all while taking note of the quirks and cross-browser issues), leading to this tutorial where I use info about my favorite footie teams as a data structure.

How data attributes work
---------------------
Data attributes are attributes that store data in page elements:
{% prism markup %}
<div id="teamInfo"
     data-team="Chelsea FC"
     data-manager="José Mourinho"
     data-home-pitch="Stanford Bridge">
</div>
{% endprism %}

The element that contains these data attributes (`<div id="teamInfo">` in the above-example) has an internal property called `dataset`, which holds all these attributes and their respective values in an object called `DOMStringMap` (an API introduced with HTML5):

{% prism javascript %}
console.log(teamInfo.dataset);
// logs "DOMStringMap {team: "Chelsea FC", manager: "José Mourinho", homePitch: "Stanford Bridge"}"
{% endprism %}

The values in an element's `dataset` property can be accessed individually:
{% prism javascript %}
console.log(teamInfo.dataset.team); // logs "Chelsea FC"
console.log(teamInfo.dataset.manager); // logs "José Mourinho"
console.log(teamInfo.dataset.homePitch); // logs "Stanford Bridge"
{% endprism %}

All of this means we use JavaScript to find these properties and display them on a web page. But [data attribute manipulation doesn't work in all browsers, specifically, Internet Explorer 10 and lower](http://caniuse.com/#search=dataset), so we need to write fallback code for those situations.

Before we create our final-production-ready code with fallbacks, we'll create some incremental examples to gain a better understanding of how all this works.

<a name="simple-example"></a>
A simple example (<a href="http://codepen.io/kaidez/pen/VYLxqG" target="blank">See the  demo</a>)
---------------------
We'll start by creating code that changes just one set of data attributes with JavaScript. Let's start with the CSS, which will be applied to all future code samples and demos:
{% prism css %}
body {
  background: grey;
  color: #000;
  font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 900;
  font-size: 18px;
}

a:link {
  color: #fff;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 22px;
}

a:visited {
  color: #fff;
}

a:hover {
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.teamListItem {
  display: inline;
  list-style-type: none;
  padding-right: 20px;
}

.dataTarget {
  padding-left: 40px;
  margin: 10px 0;
}
{% endprism %}

The HTML for this example looks like this:
{% prism markup %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>TUTORIAL: Change "data" Attributes with Mouse Clicks</title>
</head>
<body>
  <a href="#" id="chelsea">Load Chelsea FC Info »</a>

  <div id="teamInfo"
       data-team="Chelsea"
       data-manager="José Mourinho"
       data-home-pitch="Stanford Bridge">
  </div>  

  <div id="team" class="dataTarget"></div>
  <div id="manager" class="dataTarget"></div>
  <div id="homePitch" class="dataTarget"></div>

  <!-- Note that we're using the oldIE-friendly version of jQuery -->
  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
{% endprism %}

And the JavaScript for this example looks like this:
{% prism javascript %}
var team = document.querySelector("#team"),
    manager = document.querySelector("#manager"),
    homePitch = document.querySelector("#homePitch");

$("#chelsea").click(function(event){

  event.preventDefault();

  // Use the dataset property
  team.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.team;
  manager.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.manager;
  homePitch.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.homePitch;

});
{% endprism %}

Breaking down the HTML first:

{% prism markup %}
<a href="#" id="chelsea">Load Chelsea FC Info »</a>
{% endprism %}

In the HTML, clicking on the `id="chelsea` element will load the content stored in the data attributes.

{% prism markup %}
<div id="teamInfo"
     data-team="Chelsea"
     data-manager="José Mourinho"
     data-home-pitch="Stanford Bridge">
</div>
{% endprism %}

Those attributes are listed inside `<div id="teamInfo">` and named `data-team`, `data-home-pitch` and `data-manager`.

{% prism markup %}
<div id="team" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="manager" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="homePitch" class="dataTarget"></div>
{% endprism %}

On mouse clicks, those attribute values will be placed inside the three `div` tags at the bottom. Their ids are: `team`, `manager` and `homePitch`.

Breaking down the JavaScript next...

{% prism javascript %}
var team = document.querySelector("#team"),
    manager = document.querySelector("#manager"),
    homePitch = document.querySelector("#homePitch");
{% endprism %}

For those `div` tags that we're placing the data attribute values inside of , we're using `document.querySelector()` to store references to them. This will make them easier to find when I start referring to them in this next function...

{% prism javascript %}
$("#chelsea").click(function(event){

  event.preventDefault();

  // Use the dataset property
  team.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.team;
  manager.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.manager;
  homePitch.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.homePitch;

});
{% endprism %}

The `$` tells us that we're using jQuery to bind the `jQuery.click` method to the link on the web page which, again, is the one with an id of `#chelsea`. It has a parameter called `event` passed to it, which we'll discuss a little later.

When `#chelsea` is clicked, it accesses the previously-mentioned `dataset` property of the `#teamInfo` element and sees the value of all its data attributes.  So for example: after it's clicked, `#chelsea` sees that `teamInfo.dataset.team` is direct reference to the value of the `data-team` attribute in `#teamInfo`, and that the value is "Chelsea FC".

The link will then take that value and place it inside the `<div>` tags that we referenced with `querySelector()`, all with help of the `innerHTML` property. So for example: that value of "Chelsea FC" will be placed inside of ` <div id="team">`, which is referenced by the previously-created `team` variable.

OK...back to the function's `event` parameter...

We have to do this so we can use the `event.PreventDefault()` method in the link. If we don't use this and the link's `href` attribute is set to `#` (which is what's happening with `#chelsea`), then the `#` will be passed to the URL.

Depending on the page layout, this will force the page to jump to the top. Which we don't want.

*(Side note: read more about [event.PreventDefault() on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.preventDefault). There's also the similar [event.stopPropagation() on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.stopPropagation), but that blocks events a little more obtrusively then `event.PreventDefault()`.)*

<a name="proper-naming-data attributes"></a>
Proper naming of data attributes (<a href="http://codepen.io/kaidez/pen/WbvEab" target="blank">See the  demo</a>)
---------------------
Here's one of the quirks of data attributes...

As just mentioned, `teamInfo.dataset.team` is a direct reference to the `data-team` attribute...that makes sense. It's also the same thing with the manager information: `teamInfo.dataset.manager` is a direct reference to the `data-manager` attribute.

But those are one-word attributes and our `data-home-pitch` attribute is two words. So the syntax is different:
{% prism javascript %}
homePitch.innerHTML = teamInfo.dataset.homePitch;
{% endprism %}

It needs to be this way for two-word data attributes due to how   `dataset` works behind the scenes. Specifically, `dataset` will look at the data attribute names and automatically drop the data- prefix first, removing hyphens next, and finally convert the attribute to camelCase.

To better understand this, look at the HTML for this section's demo and note that it has a `data-homePitch` attribute.  Click on the *"Load Chelsea FC Info »"* link and notice that the pitch content loads in as `undefined` instead of the expected "Stanford Bridge".

Adjust the code so it says `data-home-pitch` and it will work fine.  But from there, go to the JavaScript and change `teamInfo.dataset.homePitch` to `teamInfo.dataset.home-pitch`...you'll get a browser console reference error saying "pitch is not defined".

Because of this, I suggest keeping your data attributes and `dataset` properties at a two-word minimum.  `data-home-pitch` and `teamInfo.dataset.homePitch` are fine...`data-home-team-pitch` and `teamInfo.dataset.homeTeamPitch` may work, but are too verbose.

<a name="store-data attributes-link"></a>
Store the data attributes in a link (<a href="http://codepen.io/kaidez/pen/dPoexg" target="blank">See the  demo</a>)
---------------------
The first example separated the link and the data attribute content for the sake of a clearer explanation, but a real-world use case is to store the attributes in the link being clicked on. Using the same CSS, that code would look like this:

__The HTML__
{% prism markup %}
...
<a href="#"
   id="chelsea"
   data-team="Chelsea"
   data-manager="José Mourinho"
   data-home-pitch="Stanford Bridge">
   Load Chelsea FC Info »
</a>

<div id="team" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="manager" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="homePitch" class="dataTarget"></div>
...
{% endprism %}
__The JavaScript__
{% prism javascript %}
var team = document.querySelector("#team"),
    manager = document.querySelector("#manager"),
    homePitch = document.querySelector("#homePitch");

$("#chelsea").click(function(event){

  event.preventDefault();

  team.innerHTML = this.dataset.team;
  manager.innerHTML = this.dataset.manager;
  homePitch.innerHTML = this.dataset.homePitch;

});
{% endprism %}

In the HTML, we've taken the data attributes listed in `<div id="teamInfo">` and placed them inside the `#chelsea` link. This means that `<div id="teamInfo">` is no longer needed so we can get rid of it.

In the JavaScript, we've replaced all the `teamInfo.dataset` references to `this.dataset`. `this` is a direct reference to the `#chelsea` link context, meaning it sees everything connected to it...including the data attributes.

<a name="store-data attributes-multiple-link"></a>
Store the data attributes in multiple links (<a href="http://codepen.io/kaidez/pen/GgJYLZ" target="blank">See the  demo</a>)
---------------------

In the previous example, we could have used `chelsea.dataset` instead of `this.dataset`. But by using `this`, our code is reusable and lets us create multiple links that use the same functionality.

Still keeping the CSS the same, we can add a few more links to our HTML while slightly adjusting our JavaScript.  Clicking on each link will load different info onto our page.

__The HTML__
{% prism markup %}
...
<ul>
  <li class="teamListItem">
    <a href="#"
       class="teamLink"
       data-team="Chelsea"
       data-manager="José Mourinho"
       data-home-pitch="Stanford Bridge">
       Load Chelsea FC Info »
    </a>
  </li>
  <li class="teamListItem">
    <a href="#"
      class="teamLink"
      data-team="Real Madrid"
      data-manager="Carlo Ancelotti"
      data-home-pitch="Santiago Bernabéu">
      Load Real Madrid Info »
    </a>
  </li>
  <li class="teamListItem">
    <a href="#"
       class="teamLink"
      data-team="AC Milan"
      data-manager="Filippo Inzaghi"
      data-home-pitch="San Siro">
      Load AC Milan Info »
    </a>
  </li>
  <li class="teamListItem">
    <a href="#"
      class="teamLink"
      data-team="Paris Saint-Germain"
      data-manager="Laurent Blanc"
      data-home-pitch="Parc des Princes">
      Load Paris Saint-Germain Info »
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<div id="team" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="manager" class="dataTarget"></div>
<div id="homePitch" class="dataTarget"></div>
...  
{% endprism %}

__The JavaScript__
{% prism javascript %}
var team = document.querySelector("#team"),
    manager = document.querySelector("#manager"),
    homePitch = document.querySelector("#homePitch");

 $(".teamLink").click(function(event){

  event.preventDefault();

  team.innerHTML = this.dataset.team;
  manager.innerHTML = this.dataset.manager;
  homePitch.innerHTML = this.dataset.homePitch;

});
{% endprism %}

In the HTML we've removed the id property while adding a class called `teamLink` for each of our links.  We're also no longer targeting the id in the `jQuery.click` method and, instead, targeting this new `teamLink` class.

So every time a link with the `teamLink` class gets clicked, the `this` keyword forces our JavaScript code to look at the data attributes for that link only, then load them onto the page.

<a name="getattribute-falback"></a>
Use `getAttribute()` as fallback code for `dataset` (<a href="http://codepen.io/kaidez/pen/QwbJBZ" target="blank">See the  demo</a>)
---------------------
`dateset` is awesome but, as mentioned in the beginning, isn't cross-browser compliant and doesn't work in all browsers. We can use the `getAttribute` method to fallback code for those browsers, specifically IE 10 and lower.

The CSS and HTML stay the same while the JavaScript goes through some changes...
{% prism javascript %}
var team = document.querySelector("#team"),
    manager = document.querySelector("#manager"),
    homePitch = document.querySelector("#homePitch"),
    teamValue,
    managerValue,
    homePitchValue;

$(".teamLink").click(function(event){
  event.preventDefault();

  // if "this.dataset" does NOT exist, do this
  if(!this.dataset) {
    teamValue = this.getAttribute("data-team");
    managerValue = this.getAttribute("data-manager");
    homePitchValue = this.getAttribute("data-home-pitch");

  // if but if it does, do this
  } else {
    teamValue = this.dataset.team;
    managerValue = this.dataset.manager;
    homePitchValue = this.dataset.homePitch;
  };

  team.innerHTML = teamValue;
  manager.innerHTML = managerValue;
  homePitch.innerHTML = homePitchValue;

});
{% endprism %}

We've add three new variables without giving them a value: `teamValue`, `managerValue` and `homePitchValue.` From there, we make sure that every time a link is clicked, it first checks to see if our links have a `dataset` property.

We do this using a JavaScript `if/else` statement and first check to see  `dataset` does NOT exist by saying `if(!this.dataset)`. If it doesn't exist, we'll use the `getAttribute()` method to find all the data attribute values and store them in the three new variables we just created.

But if the `dataset` property DOES exist, we'll just say that those new variables should use `dataset` to access and store those values like we've been doing up to this point.

We've made sure that the `teamValue`, `managerValue` and `homePitchValue` variables are properly storing the data attributes values, regardless of whether or not the browser supports `dataset`. So in order to get those values on the page, we just need to tell our code to look at those variable values and place them inside the elements we pre-defined awhile ago with `document.querySelector()`.

<a name="conclusion"></a>
Conclusion
----------
This was a very basic data attribute implementation and, quite frankly, data attribute implementations should be simple. Each link isn't overloaded with data attributes that have over 100 character lines of copy.

Were that my data structure or something even more complicated, I would use a pure JS implementation and ignore data attributes. That was my opinion at the start of this but reading well-respected developer [Divya Manian's excellent `dataset` post](https://dev.opera.com/articles/introduction-to-datasets/) justifies my feelings.

But for simple data structures, using data attributes will certainly fit your simpler use cases, especially if you need to load them with a mouse event. So there are many reasons to add them to your production code, and I hope this tutorial helps you.
