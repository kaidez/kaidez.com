A recent project at work *almost* required the use of swapping information in and out of the HTML DOM with data attributes (usually referred to as `data-*`). I researched current production code we had and did some web purchases.

The final functionality specs forced us to not use data attributes, but I was shocked at the lack of good tutorials on the subject. So I spent a few days hacking some code together, all while taking note of the cross-browser issues, which were easy to solve.
