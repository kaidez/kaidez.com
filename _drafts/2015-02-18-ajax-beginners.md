AJAX has advanced a lot since [Jesse James Garrett defined it in 2005](adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/ "Read Jesse James Garrett original â€˜AJAX' article"). It's described a way to create robust web applications and helped turn JavaScript into one of the world's most popular web programming languages.

Many new developers (as well as a few intermediate ones) struggle to learn AJAX and are also not aware of how it's progressed inside the jQuery library. This guide was written with those developers and jQuery progressions in mind.

<h3 class="h3-guide">How the code examples work</h3>
The code for all the examples is located in the GitHub repo and looks similar to this:

{% prism markup %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>A Sample</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endprism %}

All examples run from their own folder from an `index.html` file. `index.html` always references a minified version of jQuery 1.11.2 and a file called `scripts.js`.

jQuery is being served out from [the jQuery CDN](http://code.jquery.com/ "Visit the jQuery CDN"). Either `index.html` or `scripts.js` will change with each new example: new files may also be added as well.

Because all the examples use XMLHttpRequest, they should run from a web server and not as a local file in a web browser. Firefox can run files locally but for best results, they should run from some sort of web server.

<a name="what-is-ajax"></a>
<h3 class="h3-guide">What Is AJAX</h3>
First, understand that XMLHttpRequest is the heart of your AJAX code. With that in mind, <a href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#introduction" target="blank" title=Read the W3C's XMLHttpRequest specification>the current version of the XMLHttpRequest specification</a> helps to provide the simplest AJAX definition:

> *"The XMLHttpRequest object is an API for fetching resources."*

That's the best way to describe it: XMLHttpRequest "requests" information from a server, then places it on a web page. It does this "asynchronously", meaning that __it loads the information onto the page without needing to reload the page.__

"AJAX" stands for _Asynchronous JavaScript + XML_ but other technologies are used besides JavaScript and XML.  The original definition described it as a group of technologies working together to manage "xhr" requests inside a web page: the technologies were XMLHttpRequest, JavaScript, XML/XSLT, XHTML, CSS and the Document Object Model (or, "the DOM").

XML was defined as the main data layer but any other data layer can be used...text files, HTML files, etc. JSON is the most-used data layer at the time of this guide's initial publish date.

XHTML can be used as the presentation layer but at the time of this guide's initial publish date, using HTML5 is recommended over XHTML. If you use XHTML, using it in Strict mode is recommended.
<a name="brief-history-ajax"></a>
<h3 class="h3-guide">A brief history of AJAX</h3>
The roots of AJAX goes back to roughly late 1988/early 1999: [according to JavaScript creator, Brendan Eich](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ruby-rogues/javascript-jabber/e/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich-35282918), Microsoft was using Java to make asynchronous requests inside of its Outlook Web Access application(OWA) at that time. Due to a conflict between Microsoft and Sun (who owned Java), Microsoft removed Java from OWA.

OWA still needed to make asynchronous requests, or, "async" requests. Because of this, Microsoft created the [XMLHTTP object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms537505%28v=vs.85%29.aspx, "Read more about the XMLHTTP Object") to do just that, bundling it into Internet Explorer 5 when it was released in March 1999.

Other browsers added the object as well, but with a different implementation and called it `XMLHttpRequest`. Microsoft would copy the other implementation and also name their object `XMLHttpRequest` when they released Internet Explorer 7.

The object was used to create to web applications that loaded data asynchronously, without page refreshes. The most notable applications came from Google: specifically Google Maps and [Google Suggest](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/beginners-guide-google-suggest-marketers-seo/73269/ "Read about Google Suggest").

These web apps showed how useful "xhr" was but, for the most part, the developer community didn't really notice this. That changed in February 2005, [Jesse James Garrett wrote his influential AJAX article](http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/).

Garret's article defined the AJAX acronym and also listed its required technologies (<a href="#what-is-ajax">see the previous section for more on this</a>). The article inspired developers to create compelling web applications and continues to do so to this day.

<a name="ajax-javascript"></a>
<h3 class="h3-guide">Write AJAX with Regular JavaScript</h3>
<a name="xhr-feature-detection"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">XHR feature detection</h4>
As mentioned, Microsoft's "xhr" implementation was different from other browsers until tIE7. In the older versions, XMLHTTP was not a directly accessible object in the web browser...you couldn't access it by using `window.XMLHTTP` somewhere in your JavaScript code.

Instead, it was bundled inside of another object called
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751972(VS.85).aspx">"ActiveXObject"</a>. Since AJAX became popular while the old Microsoft implementation was still in wide use, you had to write some sort of feature-detection code to make sure that your AJAX worked in all browsers.

The simplest version of this feature-detection code looked similar to this (<a href="/samples/ajax-tutorial-samples/sample01/" target="blank">view the example</a>):
{% prism javascript %}
// sample01/scripts.js
// Feature-detect XMLHttpRequest implementation
var xhr;
if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { // Browsers other than IE 6 and lower
  xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
} else {
  if (window.ActiveXObject) { // For IE 6 and lower
    xhr = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
  }
}
{% endprism %}
The above-example creates a variable called `xhr`, then checks to see if `XMLHttpRequest` is attached to the browser via the `window` object.  If it is, then `xhr` will directly reference a new instance of `XMLHttpRequest` when doing AJAX things.

The example is also checking to see if `ActiveXObject` is attached to the browser via the `window` object. If it is, then `xhr` will directly reference a new instance of `ActiveXObject` when doing AJAX things.

Developers later realized that `window.ActiveXObject` was implemented differently across builds of all the older versions of IE. Sadly, they also realized that that some browsers heavily in use at the time didn't support `xhr` at all.

As a result, they built slightly different feature detection code (<a href="/samples/ajax-tutorial-samples/sample02/" target="blank">view the example</a>):
{% prism javascript %}
// sample02/scripts.js
// Feature-detect XMLHttpRequest implementation
// More robust detecting of ActiveX implementations
function getXHR() {
  var xhr;
  if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { // Browsers other than IE 6 and lower
    xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  } else {
    try { // Browsers with one type of ActiveXObject build
      xhr = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
    } catch (e) {
      try { // Browsers with another type of ActiveXObject build
        xhr = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
      } catch (e) {
        // Browsers that don't support either XMLHttpRequest or ActiveXObject
        xhr = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return xhr;
}
{% endprism %}
The feature detection code is now in a reusable function called `getXHR()`. The function does the cross-browser checking for `XMLHttpRequest` internally, meaning we can use "xhr" by creating new `getXHR()` instances without worrying about the "xhr" cross-browser issues.

The function checks for `XMLHttpRequest` in the same way, but we're also checking to see of the browser has one of two ActiveXObject builds and also checking to see if either `XMLHttpRequest` or `ActiveXObject` exists.

A JavaScript `try...catch` statement is looking for the different versions of `ActiveXObject`. If `try...catch` can't find it and also can't find `XMLHttpRequest`, then the value of the `xhr` variable is set to `false` and won't do any AJAX work.

`getXHR()` says `return xhr` at the end of the code. This lets us create new instances of `getXHR()` outside of the function.

There are many ways to implement MDN feature detection: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started#Step_3_.E2.80.93_A_Simple_Example" target="blank">MDN has another great implementation</a>. Also, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch" target="blank">Read about "try...catch" on MDN</a>.

<a name="load-content"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">Load content onto a page with AJAX</h4>
Loading content with "xhr" is a three-step process:
1. Wait for a 200 response code from the server.
2. Wait for a state of 4.
3. Bring everything together using "onreadystatechange".
<a name="200-response"></a>
<h5 class="h5-guide">Wait for 200 response code from the server</h5>
A web server sends many server response codes, each in the form of a numerical number.  With AJAX, the most important one is `200 OK`.

When your AJAX code sees a `200 OK` response, it knows that your "xhr" has succeeded in making the request.
<a name="xhr-states"></a>
<h5 class="h5-guide">XHR States</h5>
An "xhr" request will be in one of fives states, each with a numerical value that will be 0 through 4. The last request state, number 4, is the most important one in AJAX code, but here's a simplified description of the states.

*(NOTE: This section is here because it's an important part of the XHR spec, but because this guide focuses on the last state only, you can [skip this section](what-is-onreadystatechange "Go the "onreadystatechange" section").*

There are two widely accepted specifications for AJAX states: [the spec defined by WHATWG](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#states "Read the AJAX states definition in official XMLHttpRequest specification") and [the original spec defined by Microsoft](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/ms534361%28en-us,VS.85%29.aspx). Many web development sources, including MDN, refer to the Microsoft one.

The WHATWG spec defines five states, each with a numerical value:

* __0__: meaning that things are in the __UNSENT__ state...the code understands that instance of `xhr` has been created, but it's not doing anything.

* __1__: meaning that things are in the __OPEN__ state...the `open()` method has been invoked somewhere in our code and if you want to send any data to the server, you can do that with the `send()` method. This guide focuses more on getting things with `xhr` instead of sending things...[read about setting headers over on MDN ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started#Step_5_.E2.80.93_Working_with_data "Go to MDN to learn about setting headers in an XMLHttpRequest").

* __2__: meaning that things are in the __HEADERS_RECEIVED__ state...if you're downloading headers, the state will be set to 2 after they're finished downloading.

* __3__: meaning that things are in the __LOADING__ state...the data is loading.

* __4__: meaning that things are in the __DONE__ state...either the data has downloaded in full or there was an error during the download process.

Microsoft's definition also attaches numbers to states but is shorter. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started#Step_2_.E2.80.93_Handling_the_server_response" title="See how AJAX states are listed in MDN" target="blank">MDN shortens it even more</a>:

* __0__ (uninitialized)

* __1__ (loading)

* __2__ (loaded)

* __3__ (interactive)

* __4__ (complete)

<a name="what-is-onreadystatechange"></a>
<h5 class="h5-guide">Set up "onreadystatechange"</h5>
`onreadystatechange` is an event handler that tracks the current request state. Whether it's 0 or 4, that value will always be stored in `onreadystatechange`.

There are use cases for knowing all the times when `onreadystatechange` is equal to all the different states. But with AJAX, knowing when it's equal to 4, the `done` state, is the most important use case.

When `onreadystatechange` is equal to 4, it means that all the data has fully downloaded and is ready to be used in our code. It also could mean that the data didn't download, but this guide assumes that your final code will be written in a way that keeps that from happening.

Using `onreadystatechange` means that your AJAX code is ready to load in data (<a href="/samples/ajax-tutorial-samples/sample03/" target="blank">view the example</a>):

{% prism markup %}
<!-- sample03/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Sample 03</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="textTarget"></div>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endprism %}
We've added a div tag with an id of `textTarget` to `index.html`. Our AJAX code will load data into this element.

{% prism javascript %}
// sample03/scripts.js
// Feature-detect XMLHttpRequest implementation
// More robust detecting of ActiveX implementations
function getXHR() {
  var xhr;
  if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
    xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  } else {
    try {
      xhr = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
    } catch (e) {
      try {
        xhr = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
      } catch (e) {
        xhr = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return xhr;
}

var getArticleInfo = new getXHR();

getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange = loadText;
getArticleInfo.open("GET", "articleName.txt");
getArticleInfo.send();

function loadText() {
  var text = document.getElementById("textTarget");
    if (getArticleInfo.readyState === 4) {
      if (getArticleInfo.status === 200) {
        text.innerHTML = getArticleInfo.responseText;
      } else {
        console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
      }
    }
};
{% endprism %}
The feature detection code is the same as before, so we won't be walking through that...let's look at the other code:

{% prism javascript %}
var getArticleInfo = new getXHR();
{% endprism %}
Treat the `getXHR()` function as a constructor function and create a new instance of it with a variable called `getArticleInfo`. Again, `getXHR()` lets us use `XMLHttpRequest()` in a cross-browser compatible way.

{% prism javascript %}
getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange = loadText;
getArticleInfo.open("GET", "articleName.txt");
getArticleInfo.send();
{% endprism %}
For now, `getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange` will run a function called `loadText` any time a state changes, but our code will make sure that only happens when the state is set to `4`.

`getArticleInfo.open()` describes the data request. The first parameter is `GET` and it tells the server we want to "get" something from the server.

The second `getArticleInfo.open()` parameter is the file name of the data we're requesting. In this case, that's a file called "articleName.txt" and it contains the name of this article and the name of the article.

`getArticleInfo.send()` is the part of the code that actually sends the request through. You can pass a parameter to `send()` but it will be ignored if you do this using `GET`: the parameter will be set to its default value of `null`.

`send()` can accept and process parameters when using `POST` instead of `GET`.

{% prism javascript %}
function loadText() {
...
};
{% endprism %}
Start building the `loadText()` function that runs when `getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange` goes through state changes. These state changes are stored in the `readyState` property.
{% prism javascript %}
var text = document.getElementById("textTarget");
{% endprism %}
Store a variable reference to the `<div id="textTarget">` that we just added to `index.html`.
{% prism javascript %}
if (getArticleInfo.readyState === 4) {
  if (getArticleInfo.status === 200) {
    text.innerHTML = getArticleInfo.responseText;
  } else {
    console.log("There was a problem with the request.");
  }
}
{% endprism %}
First, check to see if `getArticleInfo.readyState` definitely equals `4`. If it does, then the data has been fully downloaded.

If it does, then the next step is to check and see if `getArticleInfo.status` definitely equals `200`. If it does, then the code has successfully contacted the server.

If our code makes a successful server connection, then find `<div id="textTarget">` on our page and place whatever content is inside of `getArticleInfo.responseText`.

`getArticleInfo.responseText` is a reference to the data we requested in `getArticleInfo.open()`, which is the "articleName.txt" file. The copy in that file will be placed in `<div id="textTarget">`.

If the code can't connect to the server and `getArticleInfo.status`  doesn't equal `200`, then the browser console will display a message saying, "There was a problem with the request."  Note that this console message will only appear if `getArticleInfo.status` doesn't equal `200`: the value of `getArticleInfo.readyState` has no effect on whether or not the console message appears.

As mentioned, AJAX can load in all different types of documents...we can tell the `getArticleInfo.open)` to load in an HTML document instead of a text one (<a href="/samples/ajax-tutorial-samples/sample04/" target="blank">view the example</a>):
{% prism javascript %}
// sample04/scripts.js
// Update the getArticleInfo.open() method only
...
getArticleInfo.open("GET", "articleName.html");
...
{% endprism %}
<a name="no-feature-detection"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">Use AJAX without feature-detection</h4>
There are use cases for including "xhr" feature detection in your code, but it's primarily required if your AJAX code needs to run in Internet Explorer versions 6 and lower. These browsers are in use less and less so it may make sense to keep this out of your code (<a href="/samples/ajax-tutorial-samples/sample05/" target="blank">view the example</a>):
{% prism javascript %}
// sample05/scripts.js
var getArticleInfo = new XMLHttpRequest();

getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange = loadText;
getArticleInfo.open("GET", "articleName.html");
getArticleInfo.send();

function loadText() {
  var text = document.getElementById("textTarget");
  if (getArticleInfo.readyState === 4) {
    if (getArticleInfo.status === 200) {
      text.innerHTML = getArticleInfo.responseText;
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};
{% endprism %}
The "xhr" feature detection has been removed...there's no need to for a `getXHR()` function that does `ActiveXObject` checks. Instead, our `getArticleInfo` variable is set to a new instance of the `XMLHttpRequest()` object.
<a name="callback-function"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">Have "readyStateChange" run a callback function</h4>
Up to this point, we've had "readyStateChange" run AJAX code with a named function up to this point: a function named `loadText()`. That works fine but we like, we can use a callback function instead.
{% prism javascript %}
// sample06/scripts.js
var getArticleInfo = new XMLHttpRequest();

getArticleInfo.open("GET", "articleName.html");
getArticleInfo.send();

getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange = function() {
  var text = document.getElementById("textTarget");
  if (getArticleInfo.readyState === 4) {
    if (getArticleInfo.status === 200) {
      text.innerHTML = getArticleInfo.responseText;
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};
{% endprism %}
We've removed one line of called since we're now using a callback function, which also makes our code slightly faster.
<a name="logical-and-error"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">Using "&&" generates an error</h4>
Developers like to use the [logical AND operator (&&)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators#Logical_AND_.28&&.29 "Read about the logical AND operator on MDN") to simultaneously check the value of both the `readyState` and `status`:
{% prism javascript %}
// sample07/scripts.js
// Update the getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange callback function only
...
getArticleInfo.onreadystatechange = function() {
  var text = document.getElementById("textTarget");
  if (getArticleInfo.readyState === 4 && getArticleInfo.status === 200) {
      text.innerHTML = getArticleInfo.responseText;
  } else {
    console.log("There was a problem with the request.");
  }
};
{% endprism %}
While the code lets `XMLHttpRequest` request and display data without error, the console message will return anyway. This is because, it's doing very limited checks.

The code using logical AND will only load the content onto the page if `getArticleInfo.readyState` equals `4` at the same time that `getArticleInfo.status` equals `200`. But if `getArticleInfo.readyState` equals `3` (meaning that data is still loading), it won't place content on the page.

But since `getArticleInfo.readyState` equals `3`, it doesn't meet the conditions set by the logical AND. So it will return the console error message anyway even though the data's loading...that's (probably) not what you want.

Most developers simply don't add a console statement but your web application may require them. You'll probably want to write a few more `if/else` checks in those case, but doing that is out of the scope of this guide.

<a name="ajax-request-mouseclick"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">Make an AJAX request with mouseclick</h4>
The previous examples used AJAX to load data automatically, but we can also make it load when events are run. Doing this with mouseclicks is common.
{% prism markup %}
<!-- sample08/index.html -->
<!-- add <button> directly above <div id="textTarget">  -->
...
<button id="getHTMLFile">Load the HTML file</button>
<div id="textTarget"></div>
{% endprism %}

Add a button tag with an id of "getHTMLFile" directly above `<div id="textTarget">`. Clicking on this button will load the contents of an HTML file inside the div tag.
{% prism javascript %}
// sample08/scripts.js
function loadHTML() {
  var getInfo = new XMLHttpRequest();

  getInfo.open("GET", "articleName.html");
  getInfo.send();

  getInfo.onreadystatechange = function() {
    var text = document.getElementById("textTarget");
    if (getInfo.readyState === 4) {
      if (getInfo.status === 200) {
        text.innerHTML = getInfo.responseText;
      } else {
        console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
      }
    }
  }
}

// Code that loads the data on a button click
document.getElementById("getHTMLFile").addEventListener("click", loadHTML);
{% endprism %}
All the AJAX code is now inside a `loadHTML()` function and there's also new code at the bottom that loads runs this function with a mouseclick. In the bottom code, the button with the id of `getHTMLFile` has the `addEventListener` method attached to it.

The button is "listening for", or "watching for", whatever event we tell it to watch for...which is `click`. When the code see's that the button has been clicked, it runs the `loadHTML` that processes the AJAX code.

<a name="multiple-ajax-buttons"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">Multiple buttons with AJAX functionality</h4>
We can create multiple buttons that load different data with AJAX:
{% prism markup %}
<!-- sample09/index.html -->
<!-- add a new <button> directly above <div id="textTarget">  -->
...
<button id="getHTMLFile">Load the HTML file</button>
<button id="getTextFile">Load the text file</button>
<div id="textTarget"></div>
{% endprism %}
Add a new button tag with an id of "getTextFile" directly above `<div id="textTarget">`. Clicking on this button will load the contents of a text file inside the div tag.
{% prism javascript %}
// sample09/scripts.js
// Pass a parameter to loadFile and refer to it in getInfo.open()
function loadFile(file) {
  var getInfo = new XMLHttpRequest();

  getInfo.open("GET", file);
  ...
}
...
// Add a new button to the bottom of scripts.js
// Have each button run loadFile() to load in a different file
document.getElementById("getHTMLFile").onclick = function() {
  loadFile("articleName.html");
};

document.getElementById("getTextFile").onclick = function() {
  loadFile("articleName.txt");
};
{% endprism %}
`loadFile()` now requires a parameter that we're calling "file". The parameter will define what file get's loaded onto the page via `getInfo.open()`.

We also updated our button code: it still runs the `loadFile()` function, but that function now needs a parameter in order to work. That parameter is the name of the file we want to load onto the page.

We also added a new button: the new button loads in a text file while the old button loads in an HTML file.
<a name="reusable-button-code"></a>
<h4 class="h4-guide">Create resusabe code for multiple buttons</h4>
The code in the last demo is fine if we only have a few buttons, but would get messy if we had to create `onclick` functionality for a lot of buttons. So it's a best to create reusable code that the buttons can share.

{% prism markup %}
<!-- sample10/index.html -->
<!--  update the <button> tags directly above <div id="textTarget"> -->
...
<button class="btn" data-file="articleName.html">Load the HTML file</button>
<button class="btn" data-file="articleName.txt">Load the text file</button>
<div id="textTarget"></div>
...
{% endprism %}
The two buttons are still on our HTML page but we're updated them. For each one, we've removed the IDS, added a class called `btn` and added a data-attribute called `data-file`.

The values of the data-attributes are unique for each button": each value is the name of the file that should be loaded using AJAX.
{% prism javascript %}
// sample10/scripts.js
// Don't change the loadFile() function
// Remove the button code for the two buttons at the bottom
// Add this new code

The button code for the two buttons is removed and replaced with this new code. The code starts by finding all the buttons with the `btn` class name and stores them as a group in a variable called `getButtons`.

Then a `for...in` loop runs for whatever the total amount of buttons there are inside of `getButtons`...there two right now. And every time the loop runs, it creates a variable called `singleButton` which stores a reference to one button at a time: that reference is the `getButtons[key]` line of code.

Next, our code tells each `singleButton` what to do when it gets clicked. What it does is, look at the value of the button's data attribute (which is one of two files) and passes it as a parameter to the `loadFile()` function to load onto the page.

Data attributes aren't supported in IE 10 and lower so we need to feature-detect for them, then provide fallback code for those browsers. We're detecting for the `dataset` property of the button being clicked, so we need to look for `this.dataset`.

We're first checking to see if `dataset` does NOT exist in the browser by saying `if(!this.dataset)`...if it doesn't exist, we get the value of the data attribute with the `getAttribute()` method.

But if `dataset` DOES exist, we can use it to get the value of the data attribute using `this.dataset`.
