If you [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/kaidez "follow kaidez on Twitter"), you know that I've been recording JavaScript-based courses for [lynda.com](http://lynda.com "vist lynda.com: a leading online learning company"). My second of two courses was uploaded to their site the day before this post's publish date.

My first course was ["Up and Running with Backbone.js"](http://www.lynda.com/Backbonejs-tutorials/Up-Running-Backbonejs/163089-2.html?utm_medium=ldc-partner&utm_source=SSPRC&utm_content=524&utm_campaign=CD2146&bid=524&aid=CD2146 "Check out 'Up and Running with Backbone.js' on lynda.com") while my second one was ["Up and Running with Ember.js"](http://www.lynda.com/Emberjs-tutorials/Up-Running-Emberjs/178116-2.html?utm_medium=ldc-partner&utm_source=SSPRC&utm_content=524&utm_campaign=CD2146&bid=524&aid=CD2146 "Check out 'Up and Running with Ember.js' on lynda.com")...JavaScript MVC all around.
