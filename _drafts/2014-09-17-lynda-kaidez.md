If you [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/kaidez "follow kaidez on Twitter"), you know that I've been recording JavaScript-based courses for [lynda.com](http://lynda.com "vist lynda.com: a leading online learning company"). My second of two courses was uploaded to their site the day before this post's publish date.

My first course was ["Up and Running with Backbone.js"](http://www.lynda.com/Backbonejs-tutorials/Up-Running-Backbonejs/163089-2.html?utm_medium=ldc-partner&utm_source=SSPRC&utm_content=524&utm_campaign=CD2146&bid=524&aid=CD2146 "Check out 'Up and Running with Backbone.js' on lynda.com") while my second one was ["Up and Running with Ember.js"](http://www.lynda.com/Emberjs-tutorials/Up-Running-Emberjs/178116-2.html?utm_medium=ldc-partner&utm_source=SSPRC&utm_content=524&utm_campaign=CD2146&bid=524&aid=CD2146 "Check out 'Up and Running with Ember.js' on lynda.com")...JavaScript MVC all around. As they're "Up and Running" courses, they're geared towards the intermediate JavaScript developer (although ANYONE with a lynda.com account can view them.)

Recording courses for lynda.com was an incredible experience and I hope to more of them in the future. I've been a big fan of lynda.com ever since my employer, Revlon, paid for subscriptions for both myself and another staff web designer...so much so, that I paid for my own subscription out of my own pocket when my Revlon one wasn't renewed.

I'm deeply indebted to lynda author [James Williamson](http://www.lynda.com/James-Williamson/128-1.html "Visit James Williamson's lynda courses") for recommending me to be an author as well. James gave me a lot of great advice on putting courses together, as did authors [Ray Villalobos](http://www.lynda.com/Ray-Villalobos/832401-1.html "Visit Ray Villalobos' lynda courses") and [Morten Rand-Hendriksen](http://www.lynda.com/Morten-Rand-Hendriksen/725535-1.html "Visit Morten Rand-Hendriksen' lynda courses") so I thank those two as well.
