If you [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/kaidez "follow kaidez on Twitter"), you know that I've been recording JavaScript-based courses for [lynda.com](http://lynda.com "vist lynda.com: a leading online learning company"). My second course was published the day before this post's publish date.
