I've been thinking about this particular post for a few months now. My initial plan was to make this my 100th post, marking that milestone as a time to review my growth as a web developer.

But some satisfying events during my first month at [my new job](/revlon/ "Read about kaidez leaving Revlon") have forced me to publish it now in the hopes it will help other web devs, especially beginning ones. The things discussed here have helped me grow as a developer in more ways then I can count.

Both [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/2013/05/10/justcode/ "Read '#JUSTCODE' by Christian Heilmann") and [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/ "Read 'Write Code Every Day' by John Resig") have discussed these things before, and probably more elegantly than I'm about to discuss them. But these things must transcend to all developers, so one more blog post about them won't hurt.

Simply put: write code every day.

Every.

Fucking.

Day.

## About the new job
As mentioned in my last post, I took a front end dev job at a health and wellness-based digital company called [Everyday Health](http://www.everydayhealth.com/ "Visit Everyday Health") where I perform a variety of web stack-based tasks. By web stack, I mean I work primarily with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The first tasks I was giving were bug fixes, JavaScript ones and CSS ones. I also had to rewrite some HTML for the sake of cross-browser/device compliance, but I started off by dealing with those bugs. 

Then I was handed a project where I had to refactor some JavaScript related to the redesign of a web form. This project was obviously tougher than the bug fixes.

I've always been a bit insecure about my web stack skills being up to par, specifically the JavaScript one. JS is an anomaly that seemingly goes through changes every minute,so I've always been a little worried as to whether or not my JS skills were up-to-date.

I went into the new job with this concern but a funny thing happened. I was able to fix the bugs rather quickly.

I don't mean to say that the bugs were so simple that a five-year old could fix them (they weren't), or that finishing the refactor makes me the world's greatest web developer (It doesn't). I mean to say that I knew how to do the tasks presented to me, and that my skills are better than I'm giving myself credit for.

## How did all this come about

I am 100% convinced that my skills are better thanks a decision I made months ago to try write at least one piece of web stack code a day. I missed as few days but I've mostly followed through with this decision.

Some of that code was work-related, some of it was for [the lynda.com courses I created](/lynda-kaidez/ "Read about the lynda.com courses I created"). A lot of it was just me firing up a new Git repo and trying out some new library or framework, or a specific part of the JavaScript core API.

And in many cases, the code I wrote required I learn something I didn't know before. Promises, complex JavaScript inheritance, web components, developing in a Node environment.

Learning new code things almost always requires the need to solve problems, particularly with JS. Something doesn't act in the browser the way you thought it would...you have to solve a problem.

Here's where I go off on a tangent...

## You are a Web ~~Developer~~ Engineer

Knowing how to solve code problems is an under-spoken skill for web developers...we need to possess it and I readily admit to understanding this late. There were incidents at Revlon in the past where I ticked off my team and took too long in solving problems.

As under-spoken it is in the web dev world, it's a must-have skill for engineers of all types...mechanical, electrical, etc.  And it's this "under-spoken-ness" that I have a problem with, because we web dev types really are engineers and not developers.

We are not _just_ bug-fixers: we are also architects that get to build cool things. I was a bug-fixer when IBut our jobs require us to be engineers when we build the cool things, meaning we need to not only solve problems with the things we build, but we need to anticipate them before we start building in the first place...as engineers do.

So I'm uncomfortable with the title "web developer" at times and think the "web engineer" or "software engineer" is better for us. t
