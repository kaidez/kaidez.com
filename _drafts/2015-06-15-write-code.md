I've been thinking about this particular post for a few months now. My initial plan was to make this my 100th post, marking that milestone as a time to review my growth as a web developer.

But some satisfying events during my first month at [my new job](/revlon/ "Read about kaidez leaving Revlon") have forced me to publish it now in the hopes it will help other web devs, especially beginning ones. The things discussed here have helped me grow as a developer in more ways then I can count.

Both [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/2013/05/10/justcode/ "Read '#JUSTCODE' by Christian Heilmann") and [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/ "Read 'Write Code Every Day' by John Resig") have discussed these things before, and probably more elegantly than I'm about to discuss them here. But these things must transcend to all developers, so one more blog post about them won't hurt.

Simply put: write code every day.

Every.

F#%king.

Day.

## About the new job
As mentioned in my last post, I took a front end dev job at a health and wellness-based digital company called [Everyday Health](http://www.everydayhealth.com/ "Visit Everyday Health") where I perform a variety of web stack-based tasks. By web stack, I mean I work primarily with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The first tasks I was giving were bug fixes, JavaScript ones and CSS ones. I also had to rewrite some HTML for the sake of cross-browser/device compliance, but I started off by dealing with those bugs. 

Then I was handed a project where I had to refactor some JavaScript related to the redesign of a web form. Obviously tougher than the bug fixes.

I've always been a bit insecure about my web stack skills being up to par, specifically the JavaScript one. JS is an anomaly that seemingly goes through changes every minute,so I've always been a little worried as to whether or not my JS skills were up-to-date.

And I went into the new job with this concern but a funny thing happened. I was able to do everything I was asked to do.

I'm not saying that the bugs were so simple that a five-year old could fix them (they weren't), or that finishing the refactor makes me the world's greatest web developer (it doesn't). I saying to say that I wasn't intimidated by tasks I was given because my skills are better than I'm giving myself credit for.

## Why are my skills are better than I'm giving myself credit for?

I am 100% convinced that my ability to do the job with no issues is a result of a decision I made months ago to try write at least one piece of web stack code a day. I missed some days but I've mostly followed through with this decision.

Some of that code was for work, some of it was for [the lynda.com courses I created](/lynda-kaidez/ "Read about the lynda.com courses I created"). A lot of it was just my trying out some new tool or framework, or playing with a specific part of the JavaScript core API.

And in many cases, the daily code I wrote required I learn something I didn't know before. Promises, complex JavaScript inheritance, web components, developing in a Node environment, etc.

But I wrote a lot of code...lots and lots and lots of code. Here's a quick snapshot of my GitHub commit map that proves it:
<img src="/img/git-contrib-map.jpg" class="imgBorderMaxWidth" alt="kaidez GitHub Contribution Map" />

The end result of getting my commit map to look this was, here's what happened at the new job:

* parsing a complex JSON API to load content onto a page wasn't a problem for me.

* using jQuery for something other than animations wasn't a problem for me.

* fixing a cross-browser error related to CSS transitions wasn't a problem for me.

* using feature detection to load in a file with pure JavaScript instead of Modernizr wasn't a problem for me.

* creating responsive web design code without using something like Bootstrap or Foundation wasn't a problem for me.

By writing code for free before on my own time before asking to be paid to do it, I was well-prepared for my new job. Simple as that. 

## You are a Web ~~Developer~~ Engineer

[I wrote a blog post May 2012](/learn-javascript-before-jquery/ "Read "5 Reasons Why You Need To Learn To Use JavaScript Before jQuery") where I talked about working with Node for the first time and found it to be not as tough as I thought it would be. I that post, I said:

> _"I don’t know all the answers to Node (and still don’t), but thanks to my JavaScript knowledge, I understand all the questions."_

I was somewhat implying that I needed to be The Omniscient Developer&trade;. That I needed to know the answer to every single solitary question about the web stack if I wanted to have a web dev career.

I was wrong.  Really wrong.

Understanding the questions is what it's all about. 

It's key to note that learning new code like this almost always requires having to solve problems, particularly with JS. Something doesn't act in the browser the way you thought it would, you have to figure out why.

Here's where I go off on a tangent...



I'm of the opinion knowing how to solve code problems is 90% of a web developer's job. Despite it being 90% of the job, it's the most under-spoken part of it.

However, it's a given skill-set for engineers of all types...mechanical, electrical, etc. Case in point: the railroads built in the continental United States in the 1800's wouldn't have come to be without engineers.








And it's this "under-spoken-ness" that I have a problem with, because we web dev types really are engineers and not developers.

We are not _just_ bug-fixers: we are also architects that get to build cool things. But our jobs require us to be engineers when we build the cool things, meaning we need to not only solve problems with the things we build, but we need to anticipate them before we start building in the first place...as engineers do.

So I'm uncomfortable with the title "web developer" at times and think the "web engineer" or "software engineer" is better for us. t
