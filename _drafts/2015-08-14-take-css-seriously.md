I've always tried to avoid rants on my blog because I've felt my opinion didn't matter. I know how to write client-side code and know that I'm <em>pretty</em> good at it, but I'm not a "leader in the web development community."

But <a href="/write-code-every-f--king-day/">I've ranted before</a> and have created enough quality code for well-established companies to insure that, until I retire, I'll be well-paid and gainfully employed because of it. So I feel I've earned the right to rant about things I <em>know</em> we web developers should be doing.

And I <em>know</em> we need to do a better job of shipping high-quality CSS.
