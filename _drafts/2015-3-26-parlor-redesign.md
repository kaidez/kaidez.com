Many, many, many years ago, I created a Flash site for a close friend of mine's hair salon, Parlor Hair Studio in Montclair, NJ. At the time, I was was really good with Flash and was able to design and develop a site that was aligned with the times.

Times have changed: Flash doesn't work on mobile, is not SEO-friendly and according to Brendan Eich, both Chrome and Firefox have blacklisted it. Plus, Flash made it was a pain to perfom even the simplest update...it was cleary a time for a change.
