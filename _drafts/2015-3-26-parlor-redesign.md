Many, many, many years ago, I created a Flash site for a close friend of mines hair salon, Parlor Hair Studio in Montclair, NJ. At the time, I was was really good with Flash and was able to design and develop a site that was aligned with the times.

Times have changed: Flash doesn't work on mobile, is not SEO-friendly, is not easy to update and according to Brendan Eich, both Chrome and Firefox have blacklisted it. It was clearly a time for a change, so a new site for [parlorhairstudio.com](http://parlorhairstudio.com, "Visit parlorhairstudio.com") was needed.

###Client Requirements

The client requirements were very straight-forward:

* make the design as modern as possible.

* make it easy to update via WordPress.

* make it mobile-friendly.

* make as SEO-friendly as possible.

###A Modern Design

My friend requested a clean, minimalist design...which is actually hard to do. This is because minimalist/flat/Swiss designs require that you do more with less.

You have to use whitespace, fonts and color in way that conveys an inviting design. This takes time: it took about three weeks of image mock-up iterations before all parties were in agreement with the final look-and-feel.

###Using WordPress

My friend wanted to use WordPress to both contain the design and that was no-brainer. Other content management systems like Joomla and Drupal have their strengths, but WordPress is immediately easy to use when compared to the others and has a wider swath of community support.
